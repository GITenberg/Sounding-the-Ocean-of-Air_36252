<p>Concerning this most important element in
which we live and move and have our being, Pliny,
in the first century of our era, wrote as follows:
"It is time to consider the other marvels of the
heavens; thus our fathers called that immense
space where flows the vital fluid to which we give
the name of air, and which is not apparent to the
senses because of its great rarity. There clouds
form, thunder and lightning also; it is the region
of tempests and of whirlwinds; from there fall rains,
hail, and hoar frost; from there come all those
phenomena, astonishing and often disastrous, which
follow the combat of Nature with herself&#8230;. The
sun's rays strike the earth on all sides, warming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg_10]</a></span>
and strengthening it; they are reflected and detach
all the particles they can carry away; vapours
descend and rise again; the winds come empty
and return laden with spoil; animals breathe in
from above this vital fluid which animates them,
and the earth sends it back to its source as if she
would fill the void by this means. So, by Nature
acting everywhere and in all directions there results
an apparent discord from which is born the harmony
of the Universe; it is this general movement which
puts all things in their places; some are preserved
by the destruction of others; all move, all act, the
struggle is continual, if it ceased an instant everything
would fall into chaos&#8230;."</p>

<p>From the earliest times, as far back as history
extends, we find mankind interested in meteorological
phenomena. This appears natural if we
consider the importance of the weather to the ancient
pastoral nations, which, from the open-air life and
keen perceptive faculties of their people, were well
fitted to study natural phenomena. The beauty
and grandeur of many of the phenomena occurring
in the atmosphere, and the curiosity excited concerning
their causes, probably contributed to interest
people in them. Meteorology appears to have
been first treated systematically, as distinct from
astronomy and astrology, by the Greek philosopher,
Aristotle, more than 2000 years ago. The word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg_11]</a></span>
"meteor," derived from the Greek "elevated," was
applied to certain phenomena having their origin
in the atmosphere. These were classified into
a&euml;rial, aqueous, and luminous meteors, and were all
included in the term Meteorology. In his treatise
by this name Aristotle gave a more detailed account
of them than any preceding or contemporary writer,
and Theophrastus, his pupil, wrote two books on
the winds and on the signs of rain, which have been
translated into Latin and English. About the
same period Aratus incorporated the current
weather proverbs in his poem, <i>Diosemeia</i>. The
Greek historians and poets frequently alluded to
atmospheric phenomena, and their example was
followed by the Romans, of whom Pliny has been
quoted.</p>

<p>No doubt the desire to ascend into the air always
possessed man, but owing to the awe with which
mountains seem to have inspired the ancients, there
is rarely mention in their writings of climbing
mountains, or of the physiological effects which
could hardly have failed to be apparent upon high
summits. Citing one of the few existing narratives,
Aristotle relates: "Those which ascend to the top
of the mountain Olympus could not keep themselves
alive without carrying with them wet sponges,
by whose assistance they could respire in that air
otherwise too thin for respiration." This mountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg_12]</a></span>
of less than 10,000 feet was said to be so high
that it never rained on its summit, where, it was
supposed, the air was always still. A still higher
mountain, easily accessible to the ancient world,
and which we know was ascended, is Etna.</p>

<p>Concerning the progress of meteorology, from
the time of the ancient Romans to the revival of
knowledge in Europe, there is little to say except
that during the middle ages meteorology, like
other learning, was confined to the monasteries.
Speculations were current as to the extent of the
atmosphere until, in the middle of the eleventh century,
Alhazen, a learned Arab, computed from the
duration of twilight that the atmosphere extended
nineteen leagues above the earth. The same
method was applied with more precision by Tycho
Brahe, Kepler, and other astronomers of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. The earliest
weather chronicles were probably noted by monks
from time to time in almanacks or missals, although
when this was done first we do not know. The
oldest daily chronicles of the weather extant are
those kept by William Merle in Oxford from 1337 to
1344. We owe it to the late Mr. Symons, the English
meteorologist and bibliophile, that this MS. and
many other old records have been brought to
light and published. Dr. Hellmann has done even
more in Germany, and this historical research is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg_13]</a></span>
evidence of the growing importance of the science
of meteorology.</p>

<p>With the advent of the age of geographical
discovery it was seen that the climatic features of
our globe depend chiefly upon distance from the
equator, proximity to the ocean, and height above
it. In the tropics especially, the luxuriant vegetation,
which diminishes on mountain slopes and
higher up gives place to snow, must have been
visible proof of the decrease of temperature with
altitude, for, as Professor Daniell remarked, mountains
are a gigantic registering thermometer having
for the freezing-point the line of perpetual snow.
The invention of instruments for measuring temperature
and barometric pressure made possible the
quantitative observations that have supplied the
data for deducing the laws governing the atmosphere.
The oldest meteorological instrument is,
no doubt, the weather or wind-vane, which had its
origin before the Christian era. The next oldest
is the hygrometer, or instrument for measuring
moisture in the air, the form which acts by
absorption dating from the middle of the fifteenth
century, and the condensation hygrometer being
a century younger. Next in chronological order
comes the rain-gauge, which appears to have been
used by Castelli, a friend of Galileo, in the year
1639. The history of that important instrument,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg_14]</a></span>
the thermometer, is obscure, but it is certain that
Galileo in Padua used an air-thermometer in the
latter part of the sixteenth century, which Rey, a
French physician, filled with liquid in 1631. This
thermometer, as well as other physical instruments,
was perfected by members of the Accademia del
Cimento at Florence. These instruments are
described in <i>Saggi di Naturali Esperienza</i>, written
in 1666, and translated into Latin and English.
The Florentine thermometers had one fixed point,
that of freezing water, and contained either spirits
or mercury. In 1724 Fahrenheit, in Danzig, fixed
three points on the scale of the mercurial thermometer,
viz. the cold produced by ice and sal-ammoniac
which he called 0&deg;, freezing water or
32&deg;, and the heat of the human blood which he
assumed to be 96&deg;. This thermometric scale,
having 180&deg; between freezing and boiling water,
and that of Celsius, with 100&deg;, are the only ones in
scientific use to-day. It is a remarkable fact in the
history of thermometers that neither of these thermometers
remained in the country where it was
invented; thus the thermometer of Fahrenheit, a
German, came into use exclusively in England and
her colonies, while that of Celsius, a Swede, is now
used on the continent of Europe except in Germany,
where the thermometer of R&eacute;aumur, a Frenchman,
is still in popular use. Of the four fundamental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg_15]</a></span>
meteorological instruments, the barometer was the
last invented. Aristotle had suspected that air
had weight, but it was not demonstrated until the
middle of the seventeenth century, when the old
axiom "that Nature abhors a vacuum" was replaced
by the rational explanation, given by
Galileo and Torricelli, his pupil, why water will
not rise in a suction pump more than thirty-two feet.
In 1643 Torricelli executed this famous experiment:
he took a glass tube, sealed at one end, and
filled it with mercury, then, closing the open end
with his finger, he inverted it in a basin of mercury.
The mercury fell to about thirty inches, which was
recognized to be the weight of a column having
the area of the tube and of the height of the
atmosphere. The application of the barometer
was due to Blaise Pascal, who repeated at Rouen
Torricelli's experiment with a much longer tube
filled with water, which being thirteen times lighter
than mercury, stood thirteen times higher, or
thirty-two feet, in the tube. Pascal, being himself
at Paris in 1648, got his brother-in-law Perier to
carry a barometric tube filled with mercury to the
top of the Puy de D&ocirc;me, a mountain in Auvergne
rising about 3500 feet above the city of Clermont.
The mercury fell in the tube with the ascent, and
at the top of the mountain it stood some three
inches lower than at the base, showing that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg_16]</a></span>
lower layers of the atmosphere are denser than the
upper. Pascal repeated the experiment on the
Tower of St. Jacques in Paris, and it is interesting to
note that more than two hundred years afterwards,
meteorological stations were established both there
and on the Puy de D&ocirc;me. It was soon perceived
that not only did the level of the mercury in the
tube change with height, but that it oscillated
continually at the same place, and from its observed
relation to the state of the weather its name
"weather-glass" is derived. In 1650 the weight of
the air was demonstrated in another manner by
Otto von Guericke, burgomaster of Magdeburg, who
by means of an air-pump of his invention performed
the experiment, which Aristotle had tried
unsuccessfully, of weighing a vessel full of air and
the same vessel exhausted of air. He also showed
the pressure of the air in all directions by the
famous experiment of the Magdeburg hemispheres,
which, being hollow, were placed together, and after
the air was exhausted from the sphere so formed
sixteen horses were unable to pull them apart.
Soon afterwards Robert Boyle experimented
further upon the weight and "spring of the air,"
as he called it, and gave the name to the barometer.
Both Boyle in England and Mariotte in
France discovered the law, bearing indifferently
their names, that the pressure of gases is proportional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg_17]</a></span>
to their density. Halley, a few years later,
showed that the rate of decrease in pressure
differed from the rate of increase in height, and
developed formul&aelig; for measuring heights by the
barometer, which were afterwards perfected by
Laplace. Knowing the heights of the barometer
at a high and at a low-level station, and the mean
temperature of the air lying between them, it is
possible to compute accurately the difference of
height of the two stations, or, conversely, given
this height, the difference in barometric pressure
can be calculated. By the middle of the seventeenth
century the most important meteorological
instruments had been invented, and not only
can Italy claim to be their birthplace, but the
Grand Duke Ferdinand II., whose brother Leopold
founded the Accademia del Cimento, distributed
the new instruments in Italy and even beyond the
Alps, so that in 1654 observations several times a
day were begun at a dozen stations. The observations
in Florence from 1650 to 1670 were preserved
and constitute the commencement of
instrumental meteorology.</p>

<p>It was the conquest of Peru which, by leading
men over the high passes of the Andes, first
brought them to great heights, but although we
find mention in the history of the expeditions of
the so-called mountain sickness, caused by fatigue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg_18]</a></span>
as well as by cold and rarefied air, it does not
appear that scientific observations were made.
Therefore, while it must be assumed that the
atmospheric conditions at considerable altitudes
were familiar to travellers, yet not until the middle
of the last century did Bouguer, one of three
French Academicians sent to Peru on a geodetic
mission, fix the height of the freezing point in
various latitudes, after observing that the temperature
fell below freezing at night upon the mountains
near the equator. During the latter part of
the century, Kirwan, an English chemist, calculated
the temperature for various parallels of latitude,
and in 1817 Alexander von Humboldt, after a
voyage around the world, published his isothermal
lines, or lines of equal temperature on the surface
of the globe, by which he showed that the deviation
from the normal, or calculated, temperature arose
from the distribution of land and water, and from
the geographical relief of the former. This work
of von Humboldt formed the basis of all subsequent
studies in comparative climatology. Meanwhile
chemistry had kept pace with physics, and in 1774
the old theory, that air was one of the four elements
from which all things originated, was rendered
untenable by Priestley, who proved that oxygen
gas, which he discovered, was a constituent part of
air. The other constituent, nitrogen, formerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg_19]</a></span>
called azote from its destructiveness to life, was
discovered soon afterwards, and its proportion in
the air determined by the French chemist,
Lavoisier.</p>

<p>In 1783 man became possessed of the long-sought-for
means of rising freely in the air, and he
speedily availed himself of it. The first balloons,
filled with heated air, were called <i>Montgolfi&egrave;res</i> from
the inventors, the brothers Montgolfier, living in
Annonay, France. After animals had been sent
up attached to one, Pil&acirc;tre de Rozier ventured to
ascend in the aerostatic machine, first tethered
captive but then set free, and before the close of
the year a balloon, filled with hydrogen gas, or
"inflammable air" as it was called, carried M.
Charles 9000 feet above Paris. During more than
a century the balloon has been the most important
agent for the exploration of the atmosphere, and
yet, notwithstanding the courage and devotion to
science of the early aeronauts, their ascents with
unsuitable instruments furnished much discordant
and erroneous data. Some of the most remarkable
balloon voyages and the modern methods of
sounding and dredging the atmosphere, to borrow
terms from the exploration of the ocean, will be
described in two future chapters.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chief reason for the slow progress
of meteorology to the status of a science is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg_20]</a></span>
variable character of its phenomena with the place
of observation. In this respect it differs from
astronomy, which was more easily cultivated in the
restricted ancient world. Only after many years
of observation at different places had contributed
a foundation for climatology was it realized that
man, in his relation to the atmosphere, resembled
marine organisms confined to the bottom of the
ocean, and that in order to discover the true conditions
of the atmosphere it was necessary to
observe them at considerable heights. In the last
century the highest point at which physical observations
had been made was the summit of Mont
Blanc, less than 16,000 feet above the sea. The
ascent of this mountain was first accomplished in
1787 by H. B. De Saussure and his guides with
much difficulty and suffering, and the observations,
abridged and rendered less accurate by the fatigue
and sickness of De Saussure, were also influenced
by the proximity of the mountain itself. In 1802
von Humboldt and Bonpland reached a height of
about 18,000 feet in the Andes, where they made
important observations. The ascent of man was
rapid during the first years of the nineteenth
century, for in 1804 Gay-Lussac rose in a balloon,
without exertion or discomfort, to the height of
23,000 feet, and there made observations which
were assumed to give the true atmospheric conditions.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg_21]</a></span>
After an active campaign the conquest of
the air by balloons was temporarily abandoned,
and the field was left free to the mountaineer.
But to-day supremacy rests with the aeronaut, for
no one has succeeded in getting higher than
24,000 feet on a mountain, while the aeronaut has
exceeded this altitude by a mile without great
hardship, and lately has sent his unmanned
balloons twice as high as the loftiest mountains.</p>

<p>The development of meteorological knowledge to
the commencement of the present century has now
been traced, but before beginning the consideration
of the methods of exploring the atmosphere
that form the subject of the book, let us, in order
to understand this work better, review the general
knowledge which we possess of our atmosphere as
regards its origin, composition, extent, and conditions
of heat and moisture. First, then, regarding
the <b>Origin of the Atmosphere</b>, or vapour envelope
which the name means. According to the nebular
hypothesis of Laplace, our earth, like all existing
suns and planets, was condensed from clouds of
nebulous matter and became a highly-heated
globular mass rotating, like every celestial body,
from west to east. As the earth cooled, a crust
was formed, and many of the substances that now
exist in the earth were suspended as clouds in the
cooler atmosphere surrounding it. Eventually,
these substances were condensed upon the crust;
the oxygen, especially, must have been diminished
by combining with the rocks, while the lighter
gases, such as hydrogen, may have escaped from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg_24]</a></span>
the earth's atmosphere. No doubt, when vegetable
and animal life began, the earth's atmosphere was
denser than now and much richer in carbonic acid,
which, during the carboniferous period, was absorbed
by plants, and is now imprisoned in coal and limestone.
Within historic times, however, there is no
evidence of any change in the composition of our
atmosphere, or the climatic conditions as a whole.</p>

<p>M. Jourdanet, a distinguished French physiologist,
maintained that man appeared on the earth
at the close of the tertiary period, when the barometric
pressure at sea-level was, he supposed,
about forty-three inches, or nearly a half more
than it is to-day, and owing to the greater density
of the air its temperature was also considerably
higher. Under these circumstances he believed
that man first occupied the high regions of Central
Asia, and only emigrated to lower levels when the
climatic conditions became ameliorated. In other
words, M. Jourdanet believed in a literal "descent
of man," but if this be true, many of the race have
returned to their birthplace, for to-day millions of
people dwell on the great Asiatic plateau, and on
the South American Cordillera, at an average
altitude of 10,000 feet, while a few live throughout
the year at extreme heights of 15,000 feet.</p>

<p><b>Composition of the Atmosphere.</b>&mdash;Dry air is a
mixture of about one-fifth of a volume of oxygen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg_25]</a></span>
to four-fifths of a volume of nitrogen, besides a very
small quantity (<sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>10,000</sub>) of carbonic acid, traces of
ammonia, ozone, argon, and other recently discovered
gases. The oxygen consumed, and the
carbonic acid given off by animal life and by
combustion, are maintained in this fixed proportion
in the free air by the absorption of the carbonic
acid, and the setting free of oxygen by vegetation.
By diffusion and the mobility of the air, a thorough
mixture is effected, with the result that the fundamental
composition of our atmosphere is everywhere
nearly the same. In the lower atmosphere
the vapour of water is present in a varying quantity,
in the average about one per cent. in weight, with
a volume depending on the temperature. Dust is
always suspended in the atmosphere; the coarser
particles settle, but the finer ones, that come from
volcanoes, may float for a long time in the high
atmosphere. Dust is an important factor in the
production of clouds and rain, and occasions many
optical phenomena.</p>

<span class="smcap">Plate II.&mdash;Optical Phenomena showing the Height of the Atmosphere.</span>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Extent of the Atmosphere.</b>&mdash;If the atmosphere
were incompressible and had throughout the
density that it has at the earth, its height would
be about five miles only, but actually it is composed
of gases that follow Boyle's law and vary in volume
inversely as the pressure upon them. Since the
pressure decreases with height in a geometrical
progression, it would be halved for each three and a
half miles of ascent were the temperature constant,
but as the temperature also decreases with height,
the successive intervals, beginning with three and a
half miles, become shorter because the volume of a
gas depends on its temperature as well as on the
pressure upon it. The decrease of pressure with
increasing height above the earth is shown by the
left-hand scale of <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>., already described, and
the subsequent diminution of density to the limits
of our measurable atmosphere is indicated on the
right of <a href="#Plate_II">Plate II</a>., Optical Phenomena showing the
Height of the Atmosphere. The gases composing
the atmosphere probably extend to heights proportional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg_27]</a></span>
to their density; viz. oxygen to about
thirty miles and nitrogen to thirty-five miles,
although water-vapour nearly disappears at twelve
miles. From these considerations it is supposed
that the atmosphere, as measurable by the barometer,
vanishes at about thirty-eight miles, and
this is about the height indicated by twilight,
which is the reflected light of the sun when 18&deg;
below the horizon. After the great eruption of
the volcano Krakatoa in the South Seas in 1883,
the brilliant sunset glows and the longer twilight
showed that the dust emitted by the eruption
remained for more than a year suspended at a
height of at least sixty miles. The so-called
"luminous clouds" seen at night during the same
period, and which were probably these same dust
particles still illumined by the sun, were found
by trigonometrical measurements to have about
the same altitude. Although it is computed that
at a height of seventy miles the air has less than
one-millionth of its density at sea-level&mdash;which is
about the density of the air remaining in the
exhausted bulb of an incandescent electric lamp&mdash;it
is there sufficiently dense to render meteors luminous
by friction after they with great velocity
enter our atmosphere. The height of these
meteors has been found, from simultaneous trigonometrical
measures at two stations, sometimes to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg_28]</a></span>
exceed one hundred miles, and if we suppose the
aurora borealis to be an electrical discharge in
highly rarefied air, measures made in the same
way indicate as great a height for our atmosphere.
The height of the aurora varies enormously, but
the average altitude of it and of the other phenomena
described, with the corresponding computed density
of the air, are shown in the preceding diagram,
in which the depth of the ocean of air may be
compared with the deepest seas and the highest
mountains. While, as Professor Young says, it
cannot be asserted that the atmosphere has any
defined upper limit, yet the kinetic theory of gases
seems to afford evidence that the molecules of
oxygen and nitrogen do not escape from the
earth's attraction, and therefore the hypothesis
of Professor F&ouml;rster is unwarranted, that interplanetary
space is filled with <i>Himmelsluft</i>, or very
thin air.</p>

<p><b>Temperature of the Atmosphere.</b>&mdash;The warmth of
the atmosphere is derived chiefly from the sun's
rays which, arrested by the earth's surface, are
partly reflected and partly radiated back through
the atmosphere. Not more than seventy-five per
cent.&mdash;Professor Langley says only sixty per cent.&mdash;of
the heat of the sun, which is received vertically on
the upper surface of the atmosphere, penetrates to
the earth, and very much less than this when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg_29]</a></span>
angle of the sun is low. The reason why temperature
diminishes as we ascend, is partly owing to
the greater loss of heat by radiation through the
thinner envelope of the upper strata, and partly
owing to the greater absorption of the heat given
off from the earth by the lower and denser strata.
In general, it may be said that there is a diminution
of 1&deg; Fahrenheit for each three hundred and thirty
feet that we rise vertically, but, this rate varies
greatly at different heights, places, and times.
For instance, the decrease is not the same on
mountains as it is in the free air, and in the
northern hemisphere it is greater on the south
than on the north sides of mountains; it is usually
greatest near the ground, and is faster in summer
than in winter. But in the average, the temperature
falls as much for three hundred and thirty
feet of elevation as it does for a change of seventy
miles on the earth's surface north or south of the
equator. When dry air rises, because it is heated
and thereby is made lighter, the laws of thermo-dynamics
show that, by reason of its expansion,
its temperature is decreased 1&deg; Fahrenheit for each
one hundred and eighty-three feet that it ascends,
and, by compression, its temperature is increased as
much if it is made to descend the same distance.
This is called the "adiabatic rate of change of
temperature," because it is produced by an alteration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg_30]</a></span>
in the density of the air, due to variation in
pressure, without the addition or loss of heat. In
the course of this book there will be occasion
frequently to refer to this law of heating and
cooling. The adiabatic rate of change is seldom
observed on mountains because of their influence
upon the currents of air in contact with their
flanks, or even in balloons, on account of imperfect
measurements, but, as will be explained in the
closing chapter, the adiabatic change of temperature
is confirmed by the observations with kites,
which furnish the best method of obtaining the
temperature of the free air up to moderate heights.
The adiabatic cooling of rising currents of air is
another reason for the rapid decrease of temperature
with height up to a mile or more. The
upper air alters its temperature from diurnal and
seasonal causes much more slowly than the lower
air, and a mile above the earth the daily change
of temperature, apart from the passage of "warm
and cold waves," is less than one degree. At a
height of six miles above the earth a temperature
much below zero constantly prevails, while, at ten
miles, 80&deg; below zero has been recorded in a
balloon&mdash;this is approximately the temperature
prevailing winter and summer above pole and
equator. These facts are expressed graphically
in <a href="#Plate_III">Plate III</a>., Temperature at Different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg_31]</a></span>
Latitudes and Altitudes, which represents half of
a section of the earth, from the north pole to the
equator, with the superincumbent atmosphere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="Plate_III"></a>

<span class="smcap">Plate III.&mdash;Temperature at different Latitudes and Altitudes.</span>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps it should be explained, that whereas the
curvature of the earth with respect to the height of
the atmosphere in the previous diagram was not
exaggerated, in the present diagram the height of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg_32]</a></span>
the atmosphere over the radius of the earth is
enormously increased. At the north pole the
mean annual temperature is about 0&deg; Fahrenheit,
and at the equator it is about 80&deg;. It is seen that
the atmospheric layer having a temperature of 50&deg;
(here represented in section by a line) touches the
earth at 45&deg; latitude, but is about two miles above
the equator. In the same way the line of freezing
(32&deg;) leaves the earth's surface at 58&deg; latitude and
rises to about three and a half miles over the
equator; the line of 0&deg; rises from the pole to about
seven miles at the equator. This is familiarly
illustrated by the fact that only the highest
mountains in the tropics are snow-capped, while
within the Arctic circle the snow-line descends
nearly to sea-level. The lines in the diagram
show the mean annual temperatures, but the
isothermal surfaces rise in summer and sink in
winter, the change of altitude being greatest in
northern regions and near the ground. Frequently
there is an inversion of temperature, that is to
say, it is warmer above than below. Notably, in
Siberia, where the winter temperature is 60&deg; below
zero, there can be no immediate decrease of temperature
with height, and it is probable that there
is a warmer layer of air interposed between the
very cold earth and the still colder upper air, so
that the temperature first rises rapidly with elevation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg_33]</a></span>
and then falls slowly to the limits of the
atmosphere. In temperate latitudes it often
happens, with a high barometric pressure, in winter
that the mountain stations enjoy a long period of
still and relatively warm weather, as compared to
that experienced in the valleys. But the subject
of inversions of temperature will be discussed at
length in considering the results of the balloon and
kite observations.</p>

<p>The observations from balloons at great heights
are neither sufficiently numerous nor accurate to
enable us to form an opinion as to what is the
temperature of interplanetary space, which the
kinetic theory of gases places at 460&deg; Fahrenheit
below zero. This temperature is called "the absolute
zero," and is calculated from the fact that air
under a constant pressure contracts <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>490</sub> of its
volume for each degree Fahrenheit it is cooled
below the temperature of freezing water, and consequently
under no pressure it should have an
infinite volume and a temperature of about 490&deg;
below freezing, or 458&deg; below zero. There are
other hypotheses regarding the temperature of
space, but since it can never be measured directly,
it will probably remain a matter of speculation.
It is certain, however, that if the earth were
deprived of its atmosphere, the temperature would
fall very low, and even with our atmosphere as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg_34]</a></span>
blanket our earth would be uninhabitable were it
not for the aqueous vapour which controls the
selective absorption of the solar rays, transforming
them into obscure rays so that they cannot escape
from the atmosphere. Water-vapour, then, is a
very important factor in the physics of the atmosphere,
but it can only be considered briefly here.</p>

<p><b>Moisture of the Atmosphere.</b>&mdash;The air is constantly
absorbing moisture from the water on the
earth, but the tension of this aqueous vapour
decreases with elevation much faster than does the
atmospheric pressure. At the height of about a
mile and a quarter half the quantity of water-vapour
is below, while we must rise about three
and a half miles to reduce the quantity of air one-half,
as may be seen in <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>. The relative
humidity, or the percentage of moisture in the air,
as compared to the amount which it could contain
at that temperature, is nearly the reverse at low
and at high levels. It is found from the kite-observations
at Blue Hill, that up to the height of
a mile or two the air is drier during winter and at
night, and damper during summer and in the day-time
than it is near the ground. At great heights
probably the air is always very dry. The condensation
of the invisible vapour into a visible form
is considered in the next chapter on clouds.</p>

<p>It is apparent that our observational knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg_35]</a></span>
of the atmosphere is gained by two general
methods of exploring it, viz. observations made
from the earth upon clouds and optical phenomena
at a distance, and observations made directly in
the air itself. Although it was realized at the
beginning of this century that meteorological
observations were almost all conducted at the very
bottom of our atmosphere&mdash;"in the shoals and
shallows of the ocean of air," von Humboldt said&mdash;yet
only within the past thirty years was it
thought necessary to replace the occasional observations
on mountains by systematic and long-continued
ones, comparable to those so generally
carried on at low levels. It is an evidence of the
zeal in America to advance the young science of
meteorology, that the first mountain-top station
in the world was established in 1871 upon Mount
Washington, and that both this exposed post of
observation, 6300 feet above the sea, and the one
more than twice as high on Pike's Peak, which
was for a long time the highest in the world, were
maintained for many years by the United States
Signal Service. The present highest station in
the world is maintained by the Harvard Observatory
upon El Misti in Peru, where, at a height exceeding
19,000 feet, a combination of self-recording
instruments was constructed by my assistant, Mr.
Fergusson, to operate during three months without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg_36]</a></span>
attention. It must be admitted, however, that the
addition to our knowledge of the physics of the
atmosphere afforded by the American stations has
been slight and incommensurate with the expense
incurred. More has been gained from the mountain
stations in Europe, notably from those in the
Austrian Alps, which have furnished data for Dr.
Hann's splendid discussions of the thermo-dynamics
of the atmosphere. While mountain stations
present the only means of obtaining continuous
observations at a considerable and constant height,
still they have serious drawbacks. Not only is the
distribution of mountains over our globe irregular,
but since they form part of the earth's crust,
terrestrial influences affect all observations made
upon them. In the case of plateaux this was at
once admitted, but by placing the stations on the
summits of high and isolated peaks, it was hoped
to approximate to the conditions of the free air.
It is now recognized that the equilibrium of the
atmosphere is so delicate that for its dynamical
study exact and minute measurements of temperature,
moisture, and currents are required, and the
methods which will be described are intended to
give the values of these elements free from terrestrial
disturbances.</p>

<p>Clouds, balloons, and kites naturally supplement
one another. While clouds indicate the direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg_37]</a></span>
and velocity of the air at different heights, yet the
lower clouds often conceal the upper strata, or
there may be no clouds at all, in which case
balloons or kites will aid us to determine the
drift of the currents. When there is little wind
at the ground, or to reach heights of several miles,
we must employ balloons, but otherwise kites are
preferable in most cases. The thermal and hygrometric
conditions of the free air can be ascertained
only by personal observations in balloons, or by
raising self-recording instruments with balloons and
kites, and this latter method it is predicted will be
the path of greatest progress.</p>

<p>Clouds must have been among the earliest
observed natural phenomena, and they were used
from time immemorial as weather signs. Yet their
every-day occurrence was very likely the reason
why their origin was not studied until about a
century ago. Father Cotte, in his classic work on
meteorology, published in 1774, devotes only a
couple of paragraphs to clouds, but Abb&eacute; Richard,
in his contemporary <i>Histoire Naturelle de l'Air</i>,
discusses the appearance and theories of clouds
in ten chapters. The cause of evaporation was
unknown in the last century, and it was not until
its close that Dalton, the English chemist, proved
that water-vapour exists independently in the air,
and Hutton explained that precipitation was produced
by the contact of a current of saturated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg_39]</a></span>
air with a colder one. Although there remains
much to be learned about cloud formation, yet
it is now pretty well established that its most
effective cause is the ascent, and consequent
cooling by expansion of the air, rather than
the mixture of masses of air having different
temperatures. The ascent of the air may result
from its being forced up a mountain slope by its
horizontal movement, or from its being drawn up
in a vortex, but most commonly the air rises from
its lessened specific gravity when warmed. If the
temperature of the quiescent air decreases faster
than 1&deg; for each 183 feet of height, which is the
adiabatic rate of cooling for dry air, as explained
in the last chapter, air warmed locally will rise and
cool at this rate until the dew-point is reached.
Then the vapour in the air will be condensed
upon particles of dust, which Aitken found to be
more numerous in clouds than outside them.
The most conspicuous of the clouds formed by
rising currents is the cumulus, or rounded summer
cloud, which has been aptly termed "the visible
capital of an invisible column of air." Saturated
air cools as it rises more slowly than dry air,
consequently the upward motion is maintained
through the cloud mass, causing the swelling up of
the tops of the cumulus clouds, which reach their
highest development in the thunder clouds, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg_40]</a></span>
cumulo-nimbus, as they are called. The lower
limit of the cloud region is determined therefore by
the height at which the rising currents reach their
dew-point, and the altitude of the cloud formation
depends upon the humidity of the ascending
current, the drier it is, so much the higher must it
rise to have its vapour condensed. In storms the
rising current mingles with the stronger horizontal
current above, which carries with it the upper portion
of the cloud, and covers the whole sky with a
uniform sheet. The wave, or ripple cloud, has been
explained by von Helmholtz and von Bezold to be
due to the undulations in a horizontal current producing
alternate rarefaction and condensation of
its water-vapour through changes of temperature.
Still another cause of low-lying clouds is the cooling
of the air to its dew-point by contact with a cold
surface, such as the earth when cooled by radiation
during a clear night, or the polar currents of the
ocean. Fog is often formed in this way, which we
call stratus cloud when it rises above us. The
highest clouds consist of ice crystals, because the
temperature of the air where they are is much
below that of freezing water. Although it is
possible to cool drops of water considerably below
32&deg; Fahrenheit without congelation, yet it can be
told with certainty that the clouds are composed of
ice if the sun and moon when seen through them are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg_41]</a></span>
surrounded by the large rings or halos, which the
theory of optics shows can only result from refraction
of light by ice crystals, whereas water
drops in the clouds produce the smaller coloured
rings, which are called coron&aelig;. The old question,
why clouds float unless their particles are hollow, is
easily answered, for they do not float, and always
tend to sink if they are not supported by the
currents of air. In sinking into warmer air the
particles are vapourized and become invisible, but
others rising are condensed and take their places,
so that the cloud persists, although its particles
change. This is illustrated by the "cloud banners,"
which frequently stream from mountain peaks, and
are caused by the rise of air up the mountain side.
Even in a strong wind the cloud remains attached
to the peak, showing that its particles are being
renewed continually; but if, as is often the case, the
wind descends on the leeward side of the mountain,
the cloud particles disappear.</p>

<p>Lamarck, the celebrated naturalist, in the opening
year of the present century, first proposed a
classification of cloud forms. Two years later
Luke Howard, a London merchant, published his
epoch-making essay on <i>The Modifications of Clouds</i>.
The theories there advanced and the nomenclature
proposed have been accepted generally to our day,
notwithstanding the more complete classifications
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg_42]</a></span>
devised by Po&euml;y, Ley, and others. Howard believed
that clouds are formed by the aqueous vapour which
rises from the earth, and that the globules which
compose them are solid, and are not filled with
hydrogen gas as had been maintained by Deluc
and De Saussure. Howard classified the clouds as
we do to-day, according to their appearance, into
three principal types, viz. stratus, cumulus, and
cirrus, which represented also low, middle, and high
clouds. Stratus is the sheet of low-lying cloud
which forms at night, and commonly rests on the
earth; cumulus is the heaped-up cloud of the
day-time; and cirrus is the curl cloud of the high
atmosphere. These three types were further
divided into four intermediate types, viz. nimbus,
cumulo-stratus, cirro-stratus, and cirro-cumulus.
Howard's nomenclature was used almost exclusively,
until in 1889 the International Meteorological
Conference that met at Paris recommended
the adoption of another classification, based on
Howard's, but modified by two experts, Abercromby
of England and Hildebrandsson of Sweden. This
classification also disregarded the origin of clouds,
and was based only on their appearance. The
next year an atlas, with coloured pictures of the
clouds, separated according to the new nomenclature,
with descriptive text, was prepared by Dr.
Hildebrandsson, assisted by Drs. Neumayer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg_43]</a></span>
K&ouml;ppen of the Deutsche Seewarte, or German
National Meteorological Observatory. This atlas
was adopted by the principal meteorological institutions
on the continent of Europe for their
observers. The preface contained the following
statement: "The study of the forms of clouds
is daily increasing in importance, both from the
standpoints of theory and of weather prediction.
Observations taken at the bottom of the atmospheric
ocean are plainly insufficient to determine
its circulation. The clouds, however, furnish
information about the condition and motion of the
air at various levels. But, a comparison of the
observations of different observers is only possible
when the same ideas are connected with the same
expressions. It is hardly possible to give a
sufficient verbal description of such indeterminate
and changeable forms as those of the clouds;
graphical representations are therefore necessary,
with the help of a short description, in order to
enable an observer to connect what he sees in the
sky with what he finds in the instructions. In
order that a cloud picture may be intelligible to
non-specialists, the clouds and the blue sky must,
at least, be plainly distinguishable from each
other."</p>

<p>The meeting of the directors of the meteorological
institutions in different parts of the world,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg_44]</a></span>
which was held at Munich in 1891, decided to
adopt the classification of Abercromby and Hildebrandsson,
and a committee was appointed to
prepare an Atlas of Clouds, which should be
cheaper than the preceding one. This committee,
of which the writer has the honour to be the
American member, met at Upsala in 1894. It
defined the various forms of clouds, selected typical
pictures to illustrate them, and drew up instructions
for observing. This atlas, which was published in
1896, is the recognized authority on cloud forms.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the United States Weather Bureau
had issued a plate of clouds, printed in one colour,
to familiarize its observers with the new system.
The Navy Department has also an interest in
clouds, for several thousand seamen in various
parts of the world send their special logs to the
United States Hydrographic Office. The Hydrographer,
a few years ago, was Captain Sigsbee,
who, long before he became known to the public as
commander of the ill-fated <i>Maine</i>, had achieved
scientific reputation from his investigations upon
the depths and the currents of the ocean. Captain
Sigsbee desired to render comparable the observations
of clouds which were being made all over
the world, and to this end he resolved to publish a
coloured atlas of the international cloud types
which should be intelligible to seamen, and yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg_45]</a></span>
not too costly for his office to supply. After two
years of experimenting, during which the writer
and his assistant, Mr. Clayton, were frequently
consulted, the <i>Illustrative Cloud Forms</i>, with and
without descriptive text, were issued in 1897 by
the Hydrographic Office, and in several respects
this atlas is the best. Still, it is impossible for
anything but a photograph from the cloud itself
to show the extreme delicacy of certain forms.
Perhaps it should be explained, however, that as
the blue sky and the white clouds act with almost
equal actinic effect upon the sensitized plate, in
order to obtain the proper contrast between sky
and cloud it is necessary either to polarize the
light from the sky, or, as is most commonly done,
to separate the coloured rays by allowing them to
pass through a yellow screen, and to fall upon
autochromatic plates.</p>

<p>Before defining the ten principal types of cloud
it should be explained that two general classes
of clouds are distinguished, separate or globular
masses, which are most frequently seen in dry
weather, and forms which are widely extended
or completely cover the sky, which are typical of
wet weather. Both these classes of clouds are
found at all heights.</p>

<p><b>Cirrus</b> are thin, fibrous, detached, and feather-like
clouds formed of ice-crystals. They are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg_46]</a></span>
highest of all the clouds, and move with the
greatest velocity.</p>

<p><b>Cirro-stratus</b> form a thin whitish veil, more or
less fibrous, which often produces halos around the
sun and moon and other optical phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Cirro-cumulus</b> are flocks of small detached fleecy
clouds, generally white and without shadows.</p>

<p><b>Alto-stratus</b> is a grey or bluish veil through which
the sun and moon are faintly visible, occasionally
giving rise to coron&aelig;. Its altitude is only about
half that of Cirro-stratus.</p>

<p><b>Alto-cumulus</b> are flocks of larger, more or less
rounded, white or partially shaded masses, often
touching one another, and frequently arranged in
lines in one or more directions.</p>

<p><b>Strato-cumulus</b> are large globular masses or rolls
of dark cloud, frequently covering the whole sky,
especially in winter.</p>

<p><b>Cumulus</b> are piled clouds with conical or hemispherical
tops and flat bases. They are formed
by rising currents of heated air, and are therefore
most common in summer and in tropical regions.
When broken up by strong winds the detached
portions are called Fracto-cumulus.</p>

<p><b>Cumulo-nimbus</b> is the massive thunder shower
cloud rising in the form of mountains or turrets,
and generally having above a screen of fibrous
appearance (False Cirrus), and underneath a mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg_47]</a></span>
of cloud similar to Nimbus from which rain
falls.</p>

<p><b>Nimbus</b> is a dense, dark sheet of ragged cloud
from which continued rain or snow generally falls.
Broken clouds underneath, forming the scud of
the sailors, are called Fracto-nimbus.</p>

<p><b>Stratus</b> is a thin uniform layer of cloud at a very
low level. When the sheet is broken up into
irregular shreds it is called Fracto-stratus.</p>

<p>Having described the origin and appearance of
the different clouds, an account will now be given
of the measurements made at Blue Hill Observatory
and the information which they give about
the circulation of the atmosphere. The work
there was taken up in 1887 in consequence of
the interest of the meteorologist, Mr. Clayton, in
the study of clouds; his discussion of the cloud
observations, published two years ago with the
Blue Hill observations, has been termed by far the
most thorough study of the kind ever undertaken
in America if not in the world. Most of the
conclusions which are stated popularly here have
their scientific expression in his work.</p>

<p>The first investigation related to the amount of
cloud at different hours of the day, and during the
various seasons. It is customary to note the
degree of cloudiness on a scale of from 0, when
there are no clouds, to 10, when the whole sky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg_48]</a></span>
is covered. For twelve years the amount of cloud
at each hour of the day has been recorded at Blue
Hill. The personal observations have been supplemented
during the day-time by an automatic
instrument called a sunshine-recorder, for it has
been proved that the cloudiness is very nearly the
inverse of the bright sunshine. Consequently, if,
as is usual there, the sun shines forty-six per cent.
of the time when it is above the horizon, the cloudiness
is very nearly fifty-four per cent., which is the
average for the year. The instrument generally
used for this purpose is a glass sphere which acts
as a burning-glass, and chars a strip of cardboard
placed concentrically around the lower part of the
sphere. As the sun moves, the image on the card
moves in the opposite direction over the card,
burning a line as long as it shines, but leaving the
card untouched when it is cloudy. In a similar
way a record may be obtained on sensitized "blue
paper" by allowing the sun's rays to enter a dark
chamber containing the paper. The maintenance
of personal observations at each hour of the night
is arduous, and, therefore, during ten years an
automatic instrument has been used at Blue Hill
which deserves to be better known. It is called
the pole-star recorder, and was devised by Professor
Pickering, director of the Harvard College
Observatory.  The instrument is very simple,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg_49]</a></span>
and consists of a telescopic camera focussed on
Polaris. This star is not at the north pole of the
heavens but a little more than a degree distant,
and, consequently, it describes a small circle in the
heavens during twenty-four hours. When the sky
is clear around Polaris its trail upon the photographic
plate is continuous, but when the sky is
partly or entirely covered with clouds the trail is
broken or obscured. Of course the plate is not
exposed until after dark, and a shutter is closed
by a clock before dawn. The only hourly records
of cloudiness at night in the United States are
obtained by this instrument on Blue Hill and at
Cambridge. It will be objected, perhaps, that the
cloudiness derived from observations of the sun or
the pole-star is not the amount over the whole sky,
but only that in the region of the luminary. This
is true, but it is found that the average of the
records for a month or a year agrees very closely
with the average of estimates of cloudiness over
the whole sky during these periods. The use of
the pole-star is preferable to that of the sun,
because in our latitude it gives values at a point
about half-way between the horizon and the zenith;
while since the sun travels at a variable height across
the sky, when its altitude is low the same mass of
cloud may intercept more sunlight than when it
shines vertically. From ten years' observations the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg_50]</a></span>
following deductions have been made concerning
the variation in the amount of cloud at Blue Hill.
For all the months the diurnal amount of cloud is
greatest about one o'clock in the afternoon, on
account of the frequency of cumulus clouds near
the warmest part of the day, while the next
greatest amount, due to the frequency of stratus
clouds, occurs near sunrise, or at the coldest time
of day. All over the world the least cloudiness is
in the evening, when the sum of the combined
effects of radiation and <a name="insolation"></a><ins title='was "isolation"'><a href="#CORRIGENDA">insolation</a></ins> is least. The
annual period in the cloudiness is complex, because
the amount of cloud is connected with changes of
humidity at many different levels in the atmosphere,
but in the northern hemisphere there is
most cloud during the first half of the year and
least during the latter half, probably because the
increasing warmth at the earth's surface produces
increased ascending currents until summer, while
the chilling of the earth's surface in the autumn
becomes unfavourable for ascending currents. The
distribution of cloud over the globe is intimately
connected with the general atmospheric circulation,
being greater where there are rising currents and
less where there are downward currents. The
reason, naturally, is that as descending air becomes
warmer and therefore relatively drier, the clouds
in it evaporate and disappear.  A cloudy belt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg_51]</a></span>
encircles the earth at the equator, and on either
side are two belts of less cloud, but in higher
latitudes the cloudiness increases. If we could
see our earth from outside its atmosphere, the light
reflected from the upper surfaces of the cloud-belts
would probably make them appear bright. From
the markings on a planet that are known to be
caused by condensation, a French meteorologist,
M. Teisserenc de Bort, believes that the circulation
of its atmosphere can be inferred, for wherever on
the surface of the planet bright spots are seen,
there the vapour of rising currents should be
condensed. If this be true, there is a resemblance
between Jupiter, as we see it, and the earth as it
would appear from another planet, the bright
bands being cloud surfaces, and the dark patches
glimpses of the surface of the planet beneath.</p>

<p>Observations of the direction of motion, and
apparent velocity of clouds at different heights,
have been made at Blue Hill several times a day
since 1886. To measure the motion of clouds the
nephoscope (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>) is used. It consists of a horizontal
circular mirror with a concentric circle of
azimuths and an eye-piece <i>C</i>, movable in a plane
<i>BD</i> at right angles to the mirror and also around
it, through which the image of the cloud is brought
to the centre of the mirror <i>A</i>. It can be proved
by geometry that the motion of the cloud-image is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg_52]</a></span>
proportional to the movement of the cloud itself,
so by noting in what direction and how far the
image is displaced in a given time, we have the
true direction of motion of the cloud itself and
also its relative velocity, comparable with the
velocity of all clouds having the same height. If
the height is known, then the relative velocity can
be easily converted into absolute velocity, and
thus the velocity of currents at different heights
in the atmosphere is accurately ascertained.</p>

<p>The height of clouds seems to have been
measured trigonometrically from two stations as
early as 1644 by Riccioli and Grimaldi, two Jesuits
of Bologna, but notwithstanding these measurements
and some conclusions derived from observations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg_53]</a></span>
on mountains, and in balloons, the altitudes
of the different clouds were not known with any
accuracy until in 1884 Ekholm and Hagstr&ouml;m
made a series of trigonometrical measurements
upon the different kinds of clouds at Upsala,
Sweden. About the same time attempts were
made at Kew Observatory to measure clouds by
photography, and in 1885 probably the first trigonometrical
measurements in America were made
at Cambridge, Mass., by Professor W. M. Davis
and Mr. A. McAdie. In 1890-91 the Swedish
methods were employed at Blue Hill by Messrs.
Clayton and Fergusson of the Observatory staff,
and until recently the measurements there and at
Upsala comprised all that was known accurately
about the heights and velocities of the various
species of clouds.</p>

<a name="Fig_2"></a>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Cloud Theodolite at Blue Hill Observatory.
</div>

<p>The trigonometrical measurements at Blue Hill
were made as follows: at two stations, one at
the Observatory, the other at the base of the hill
about a mile distant, two observers determined
simultaneously the angular altitude and azimuth
of some point on the cloud which was agreed upon
by telephonic conversation. If, as is generally the
case, the lines of sight did not meet, the trigonometrical
formul&aelig; gave the height of a point midway
between the crossing of these lines. Such was the
accuracy of these measurements that the probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg_54]</a></span>
error of the calculated heights of the highest clouds
is only a few hundred feet. Successive observations
at the two stations of the position of the cloud
enabled its velocity to be calculated, or, as already
explained, this may be got from the relative
velocity measured at one station, if the height of
the cloud be known. <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a> shows the theodolite
on the tower of the Observatory. Five other
methods of measuring clouds have been employed
at Blue Hill: (1) The only method of finding the
height of lofty and uniform cloud strata is by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg_55]</a></span>
means of the light thrown on them from below,
and on Blue Hill the electrical illumination of the
surrounding towns is utilized. The angle which
the centre of the illumination makes with the
horizon is measured, and knowing the distance of
the town, the right-angled triangle may be solved.
(2) An accurate method for low and uniform
clouds is to send kites into them, as will be
explained in the closing chapter. (3) When the
clouds are low enough to cast shadows on the
ground, the angles of the cloud and sun as seen
from the Observatory are measured, and with the
distance of the shadow from the hill-top, ascertained
by a map, this triangle can be solved. The times
of passage of the shadow over known points on
the landscape afford another means of calculating
its velocity. (4) A method that was suggested
by Espy, the pioneer American meteorologist, for
getting the altitude of the bases of clouds lying
within a mile of the earth, is to find the difference
in temperature between the air and the dew-point
at the ground, and to compute the height at
which this difference should disappear. When the
temperature of the rising currents increases, as on
warm days, and the level of the dew-point rises
higher, the cloud can be seen to ascend, and, in
fact, the measurements at Blue Hill show that the
clouds of moderate altitude are highest during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg_56]</a></span>
warmest part of the day. (5) Finally, very low
stratus or nimbus may be measured by noting the
heights of their bases on the sides of the hill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The identity of cloud-forms all over the world
has been established, and as a result of the measurements
at Blue Hill, the heights and speed of all
clouds observed there are known. The averages
have been plotted in the five levels into which
we separate the clouds in <a href="#Plate_IV">Plate IV</a>., Heights
and Velocities of Clouds, where ordinates represent
heights and absciss&aelig; velocities, and, consequently,
the distances of the various forms of
clouds above the horizontal base indicate their
heights, and the distances from the left-hand
vertical line their velocities. For comparison, the
velocity of the wind on Blue Hill, a few hundred
feet above the general level of the country, is
represented. The mean height of the cirrus is
about 29,000 feet, but this cloud sometimes
reaches 49,000 feet. The mean height of the
cumulus is about a mile, but the tops of the
cumulo-nimbus, or thunder-shower cloud, sometimes
penetrate into the cirrus level. Generally
the base of the nimbus, or rain cloud, is only 2300
feet above the ground, and it frequently sinks
below the top of Blue Hill, which is only 630 feet
above the sea. The poetic saying, that "Earth
wraps her garment closer about her in winter," has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg_57]</a></span>
a scientific basis, for the average height of all the
clouds is greatest in summer and least in winter.
But the reverse is true of their velocity, for the
entire atmosphere moves twice as fast in winter as
it does in summer, and at the lower levels the
seasonal change is even greater. The average
velocity of cirriform clouds is ninety miles an hour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg_58]</a></span>
in winter, and sixty miles in summer, but occasionally
in winter cirrus have been found to have the
enormous velocity of two hundred and thirty miles
an hour. In the average, the velocity of the
currents increases, from the lowest to the highest
clouds, at the rate of about three miles an hour for
each 1000 feet of height, but near the ground the
increase with height is faster. It has been found
that the velocity of the lower clouds is less than
the velocity of the wind on a mountain of the same
height, which may, perhaps, be explained on the
supposition that the mountain acts like a dam to
accelerate the flow of air over it. The measurements
in Sweden showed that the middle and
upper levels of clouds are higher than in America,
but that they move less rapidly. This may be
because the surfaces of equal temperature in the
air are higher in the United States than in Sweden,
on account of the direction of the upper currents,
while the greater velocity of our high clouds corresponds
with the more rapid movement of areas of
low and high barometric pressure over the United
States.</p>

<p>These results are suggestive. For instance, the
energy of the upper half of the mass of the
atmosphere, or that portion which lies above 18,000
feet, has been calculated to possess six times the
energy of the lower half in which we live, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg_59]</a></span>
as yet, none of this enormous store of energy is
applied to the use of man. While it appears
certain that no navigable balloon or flying machine
will ever be able to stem the enormous velocity of
the upper atmosphere, rarified though it is, perhaps
in the future a&euml;rial machines will take advantage
of the prevailing currents of the high atmosphere,
as our sailing ships do of the trade winds. The
observations of cirrus clouds in various parts of
the world show that they always move from a
general westerly direction, while below this primary
drift toward the east occur the relatively permanent
or transient differences of pressure which
cause the deviations from the normal circulation of
the atmosphere, and give rise to the local circulation
in storms. In the familiar daily weather map it
will be noticed that there is usually some portion
marked "low," and another portion marked "high."
The former is an area of low barometric pressure,
into which the winds at the ground blow spirally
inward in the <a name="opposite"></a><ins title='added "opposite"'><a href="#CORRIGENDA">opposite direction</a></ins> that the clock hands turn;
the latter is an area of high barometer, out of which
the winds at the ground blow in the contrary
way. The former when well developed are called
"cyclones," and are usually accompanied by stormy
weather, and the latter, called "anti-cyclones," bring
fair weather. From the observations of the directions
from which the clouds move in cyclones and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg_60]</a></span>
anti-cyclones, we have found that above the
cumulus level (at the height of about a mile) the
inward inclination of the wind in a cyclone, and
the outward inclination in an anti-cyclone, both
disappear, and the general drift from the west
prevails. The results of the observations are
shown in <a href="#Plate_V">Plate V</a>., Atmospheric Circulation in
Cyclones and Anti-cyclones, representing sections
of the atmosphere, concentric to the earth's surface,
in the five cloud-levels seen from above. The
arrows fly with the wind and are proportional in
length to its velocity, the dotted arrows indicating
the probable flow of the air through the cyclones
and anti-cyclones that are indicated by the circles,
their axes being assumed to be nearly perpendicular
to the earth's surface. Above the cumulus
it will be observed that the wind in the cyclone
tends to come from the south-west in front and
from the north-west in the rear, while in the anti-cyclone
the contrary is the case, indicating a
deflection of the westerly upper current to the
right in cyclones and to the left in anti-cyclones.
This sustains the theory that the cyclonic
circulation is struggling against a general atmospheric
drift from the west which increases with
altitude, and above the height of a mile becomes
greater than the cyclonic influence. Higher than
this, the atmospheric circulation is controlled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg_62]</a></span>
primarily by the permanent temperature gradient
between equator and pole, by the seasonal
temperature gradient between ocean and continent,
and, in the United States, by the passage of "warm
and cold waves." Mr. Clayton's investigations
indicate that the motion of the upper clouds is
nearly parallel to the lines of equal temperature
at the earth's surface. A high temperature, by expanding
the air upward, causes in the upper air a
high pressure; and a low temperature, by contracting
the air towards the ground, causes in the
upper air a low pressure, so that the lines of equal
pressure in the upper air are parallel to the lower
lines of equal temperature, and since there is little
friction in the upper air the motion of the wind
is nearly parallel to the lines of equal pressure.
Below the cumulus level the winds follow the
normal cyclonic and anti-cyclonic circulation.
There are two theories of the origin of these areas
of high and low pressure, the "driven theory" which
supposes that they derive their energy and drift
from the general atmospheric movement from west
to east, and the "convectional theory" which
attributes their formation and progression to the
difference of temperature between them and the
adjacent air. While the observations on mountains
have favoured the driven theory, yet the
inward spiral motion of the cirrus clouds above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg_63]</a></span>
anti-cyclone, indicating a lower pressure than in
the surrounding air, contradicts the hypothesis,
and the recent observations with kites at Blue
Hill strongly support the convectional theory of
cyclones.</p>

<p>The relation of the clouds to weather forecasting
has been investigated at Blue Hill. For instance,
it is found, in this region at least, and contrary
to the general opinion, that cirrus clouds do not
indicate rain, but do foretell a change of temperature
that is proportional to the rapidity of
motion of the clouds. Alto-cumulus is followed
by rain within twenty-four hours three times in
four. Rain follows the appearance of all high and
intermediate clouds most frequently when the
cloud banks are densest toward some westerly
point and when they come from the west. Mr.
Sweetland, an assistant, has studied special forms
of cloud in their relation to the succeeding weather.
He concludes that cirrus plumes precede fair
weather, while dense clots of cirro-cumulus are
followed by rain. Rounded pendants, or mammillated
clouds, in the lower levels indicate rain, but
in the upper levels fair weather. Of all the forms,
the dark sheet of stratus, and clouds of lenticular
shape, are most frequently followed by rain. Of
clouds presaging changes in temperature, the
turreted cumulus, which is connected with thunder-storms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg_64]</a></span>
precedes the greatest fall in temperature,
and next in order come lenticular clouds, flaky
cirrus, and alto-cumulus. In general, flat and
flaky clouds, clouds forming and disappearing
rapidly, and clouds changing to forms at a higher
level precede dry and cooler weather.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this modern study of clouds
as prognostics simply adds to the weather proverbs
that have come down to us from the time of
Theophrastus. It does not appear, however, that
cloud forms alone can usually serve to predict
rain for more than twenty-four hours, but for a few
hours in advance the appearance of certain cloud
forms frequently furnishes the observer more
trustworthy signs of coming rain than does the
synoptic weather map. To a forecaster in possession
of telegraphic data, the prevalence of
rapidly-moving cirrus over a wide area indicates a
rapid storm movement, with sudden and marked
changes of weather and of temperature, while
slowly-moving cirrus indicate slight changes of
temperature and dry weather. The direction of the
cirrus movements in front and around a storm
centre will usually point out the future movement
of the storm, which tends to advance in the same
general direction.</p>

<p>The work done at Blue Hill shows the importance
of cloud observations to elucidate the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg_65]</a></span>
movements of the atmosphere, as well as the
circulation of the air above barometric maxima
and minima, which can result practically in making
accurate weather forecasts possible a day or two
in advance. The systematic observation of the
upper currents was brought to the attention of the
International Meteorological Committee by Dr.
Hildebrandsson in 1885, and at the meeting of the
International Cloud Committee in 1894, besides
the adoption of the nomenclature of clouds and
instructions for observing them, it was decided
that observations of their motion, as well as
measurements of their height, should be made in
various parts of the world. Accordingly, the year
commencing May 1, 1896, was designated as the
"International Cloud-Year," and observations with
nephoscopes of the direction of motion and relative
velocity of clouds were begun at many stations in
Europe and Asia, and at fifteen stations in the
United States. Trigonometrical measures of the
heights of clouds were undertaken at stations in
Norway and Sweden, Russia, Finland, Prussia, and
France, as well as at Toronto, Manila, and Batavia;
in the United States the measurements already
described were recommenced at Blue Hill, and the
Weather Bureau equipped a similar station in
Washington. In Europe it is thought that the
determination of heights by photogrammeters, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg_66]</a></span>
the theodolites with attached photographic cameras
are called, possesses advantages over the visual
theodolites, and it is true that not only is the kind
of cloud recorded on the plates, but there are available
for calculation as many points on the cloud as
can be identified on the two plates exposed simultaneously
at both stations. On the other hand, in
the case of nearly uniform or dark cloud-strata, it
is easier to see points for measurement on the
cloud than to fix them on the photographic plates.
For this reason, and from the difficulty of manipulating
the photogrammeter, visual instruments
were adopted both at Blue Hill and at Washington.
The work was successfully carried on until May 1,
1897, and the observations and measurements were
reduced at Blue Hill according to the plan prescribed
by the Committee. Already the observations
and measurements made at Upsala, Manila,
and Blue Hill are published, and the others will
follow. The discussion of the correlated data from
the various countries will probably increase our
knowledge of the circulation of the atmosphere,
which is certainly one of the most interesting and
important questions in the physics of the globe.
The result will have been reached by international
co-operation, of which the benefits to science are
everywhere manifest to-day. But for the whole
problem to be solved, it is necessary, not only to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg_67]</a></span>
know the movement of the air, but, as far as
possible, to ascertain its conditions of heat and
moisture. This may be accomplished by the use
of balloons and kites, to be described in the
remaining chapters.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>BALLOONS&mdash;NOTABLE ASCENTS AND RESULTS OBTAINED&mdash;CAPTIVE
BALLOONS</p></div>


<p>In the first chapter the invention of the hot-air
and the hydrogen balloon was chronicled, and it
was stated that on December 1, 1783, Charles rose
from Paris to a height of 9000 feet. Public
interest in France was greatly excited by this
wonderful extension of the realm of man, and
numerous ascensions with <i>Montgolfi&egrave;res</i> and
<i>Charli&egrave;res</i>, as the hot-air and hydrogen balloons
were respectively called, took place in Paris and
the provinces. The uses of the balloon seemed
innumerable, and Lavoisier was instructed by the
Academy of Sciences to draw up a report on the
value of the new discovery. After having described
in detail the ascensions which he had witnessed,
the great chemist stopped, appalled at the multitude
of problems which the balloon could solve.
History has shown, however, that no commercial
application of the balloon was possible, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg_69]</a></span>
aside from its spectacular attractions, its chief use
has been for scientific observations.</p>

<p>The first persons in England who devoted themselves
to a&euml;rial navigation were foreigners. Two
of them were Italians, the philosopher Tiberius
Cavallo, who already in 1782 had showed to a
London assembly that soap-bubbles filled with
hydrogen will rise, and therefore had almost anticipated
the invention of the hydrogen balloon, and
the diplomatist Vincent Lunardi, who made some
daring balloon ascents in 1784. But the honour
of making the first scientific balloon voyage is due
to a Bostonian, Dr. John Jeffries. Dr. Jeffries
graduated at Harvard College in 1763 and then
practised medicine in England, where he became a
loyalist, and during the Revolution was with the
British troops. In London he interested himself
in aerostation, and, aided by the Royal Society,
ascended in a balloon because, he said, "I wished
to see the following points more clearly determined:
first, the power of ascending or descending
at pleasure, while suspended and floating in
the air; secondly, the effect which oars or wings
might be made to produce towards the purpose
and in directing the course of the balloon; thirdly,
the state and temperature of the atmosphere at
different heights from the earth; and fourthly, by
observing the varying course of the currents of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg_70]</a></span>
air, or winds, at certain elevations, to throw some
new light on the theory of winds in general." A
French professional aeronaut named Blanchard
had made three ascents in France and one in
England, and Dr. Jeffries paid one hundred guineas
to accompany Blanchard on his fifth ascent, which
was made from London November 30, 1784. He
took with him a thermometer, a barometer, a
hygrometer, an electrometer, and a mariner's compass,
also several numbered bottles, filled with water
and provided with glass stoppers, which were to
be emptied and corked up at different heights in
the atmosphere. It was arranged to record the
observations on ruled paper with a silver pen,
because the doctor would not trust a common pen
or pencil as liable to accident. He also had a
map of England to determine the direction which
the balloon took. Jeffries' English sentiments are
shown by this quotation from his narrative: "I had
provided a handsome British flag, invidiously represented
the next day in one of the public papers
to have been the flag of the American States."
The barometer and thermometer were observed
every few minutes, and the hygrometer occasionally.
The electrometer did not change its indications.
Samples of air were obtained and sent to the
Royal Society, but it does not appear that they
were ever analyzed. The balloon rose nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg_71]</a></span>
two miles, and descended safely in Kent after an
hour and a half. Jeffries' observations compare
favourably with those made until recently; indeed,
for nearly a century there was little improvement
in the apparatus. The decrease of temperature
which Jeffries found, viz. 1&deg; for 360 feet rise, and
the decreasing humidity with height agree very
well with later observations.</p>

<p>Jeffries and Blanchard undertook a more perilous
voyage on January 7, 1785, from Dover across the
Channel, landing in the province of Artois, after, so
runs the announcement, "we were suspended and
floating in the atmosphere two hours over the sea
and forty-seven minutes over the land of France."
The voyagers were cordially welcomed, and were
entertained lavishly in Paris as being, Jeffries says,
"the first who passed across the sea from England
into France by the route of the air." No instruments
but a barometer and a compass were carried, and
the only scientific result worthy of notice was that
the balloon seemed to lose buoyancy over the sea,
due to what Jeffries thought might be "the power
of attraction over the water." The height of the
balloon was measured trigonometrically by French
officers in Calais, who found by angular measures,
when the balloon was midway across the Channel,
that its height was 4500 feet. Jeffries' voyages
have been described somewhat at length because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg_72]</a></span>
the first scientific balloon voyage is generally
attributed to the Belgian physicist, Robertson, who
ascended from Hamburg in 1803 to the improbable
height of 24,000 feet. Robertson made his third
ascent the next year from St. Petersburg, accompanied
by the Academician Sacharoff. This was a
scientific voyage, instituted at the request of the
Russian Academy, to ascertain the physical state
of the atmosphere and the component parts of it
at different heights, also the difference between the
results of vertical ascents and the observations of
Deluc, De Saussure, von Humboldt and others on
mountains, which it was rightly concluded could
not be so free from terrestrial influences as those
made in the open air. Among the experiments
which the Academy proposed were the following:
change of rate of evaporation of fluids, decrease or
increase in the magnetic force, inclination of the
magnetic needle, increase of heat of the solar rays,
fainter colours in the spectrum, influence of rarefaction
of the air on the human body, as well as
some other chemical and philosophical experiments.
A height of about two miles was reached,
and many interesting observations were made, but
since the instruments were not easily used in the
basket of the balloon, the results were unsatisfactory
and required repetition to be conclusive.</p>

<p>The Academy of Sciences of Paris now took up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg_73]</a></span>
the investigation with the special object of proving
whether the magnetic force decreased as Robertson
in a balloon and De Saussure in the Alps had
supposed. Two young physicists, Biot and Gay-Lussac,
were chosen to carry out the investigations.
They ascended from Paris on August 24, 1804,
provided with all necessary instruments, but the
balloon was too small to rise higher than 13,000
feet. Gay-Lussac ascended alone to a height of
23,000 feet on September 16, 1804, in a balloon
filled with hydrogen. His observations confirmed
those which he had made with Biot, that there was
no change in the magnetic force, and from samples
of air collected he proved that the chemical constitution
of the air is invariable. His observations
of temperature seemed to confirm the theory of a
decline of temperature of 1&deg; in 300 feet of elevation.
The air was found to be very dry, and Gay-Lussac
noticed that at the highest altitude the clouds were
still far above him.</p>

<p>Passing over several notable ascents in other
countries, it was not until 1850 that scientific
ballooning was begun again in the land where the
balloon originated. Then MM. Barral and Bixio
made two ascents from Paris in rainy weather to
the heights of 19,000 and 23,000 feet respectively,
although they had expected to attain twice these
altitudes. Their most interesting observations were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg_74]</a></span>
the great thickness of the cloud mass, which in one
case amounted to 15,000 feet, and the sudden
fall of temperature in it from +15&deg; to -39&deg;.
Some curious optical phenomena were connected
with the floating ice crystals, and although the light
of the sky was found to be strongly polarized, the
light reflected from the clouds was not polarized.</p>

<p>The field of operations was now transferred to
England, where, under the auspices of the British
Association, four ascents were made by John
Welsh of the Kew Observatory in the great
<i>Nassau</i> balloon managed by Green, the veteran
aeronaut. The special object of these investigations,
like those in France, was the determination
of the temperature and hygrometric condition
of the air at different elevations. Besides this,
samples of air at different heights were collected
for analysis and the light reflected from clouds
was examined for polarization. Recognizing that
on account of the calm prevailing in the car of the
balloon and the great solar radiation, the readings
of the thermometer would be affected, Welsh enclosed
the thermometers in polished tubes through
which air was forced by bellows. This was the
first aspirated thermometer, which alone gives the
true temperature of the air with the conditions
prevailing in a balloon. The instrument fell into
oblivion until a few years ago, and to this fact is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg_75]</a></span>
due the fictitious temperatures generally obtained
by aeronauts. Welsh reached heights of from
12,500 to 23,000 feet, and his observations showed
that the temperature of the air decreased uniformly
with height until at a certain elevation, varying on
different days, the decrease is arrested, and for a
space of 2000 or 3000 feet the temperature remains
nearly constant, or even increases slightly; the
regular diminution being afterwards resumed and
generally maintained at a less rapid rate than in
the lower air, and commencing from a higher
temperature than would have existed but for the
interruption. The variation of the decrease with
the seasons was also demonstrated. The humidity
did not change much with height, and it was
nowhere very dry. Finally, the light of the clouds
was proved not to be polarized, and the permanent
composition of the atmosphere was confirmed.</p>

<p>In 1861 another grant of money was made by
the British Association for balloon experiments to
be performed, under the direction of a Committee,
by Mr. James Glaisher, then engaged in geodetic
and meteorological work in England. Between
1862 and 1868 Glaisher, accompanied by the aeronaut
Coxwell, made thirty ascents. They attained
three times a height exceeding 23,000 feet, and once
more than 29,000 feet, when they believed that the
balloon rose to 37,000 feet. The primary objects of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg_76]</a></span>
Glaisher's experiments were as follows: determination
of the temperature of the air and its
hygrometrical conditions up to five miles, comparisons
of an aneroid barometer with a mercurial one,
determination of the electrical state of the air and
of its oxygenic state by means of ozone papers,
time of vibration of a magnet at different distances
from the earth. Secondary objects of study were
the composition of the air, the form and thickness
of clouds, the atmospheric currents, acoustical
phenomena, etc. In order to obtain many observations
frequent ascents were necessary, as the
insular position of England precluded long voyages.
During 1869 ascents in a captive balloon up to
1700 feet supplemented the employment of the
free balloon, which from its rapid rise and fall made
observations in it near the earth impossible.
Glaisher was a good observer; his instruments
were excellent, and had been previously tested, but
their exposure in the basket of the balloon was
bad, and although the thermometer was provided
with an aspirator similar to Welsh's, Glaisher,
noticing that the readings agreed with those of a
freely exposed thermometer, hastily concluded
that the use of the aspirator was unnecessary, and
so discarded it.</p>

<p>Until quite recently Glaisher's results were
accepted as representing the conditions of the free
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg_77]</a></span>
air up to the greatest height which it was possible
to reach. These results showed that the temperature
did not fall uniformly with height, but that it
fell most rapidly near the earth and much less
rapidly at great heights. In cloudy weather up to
the height of a mile the mean decrease of temperature
in the day-time differed little from the theory of
1&deg; per 300 feet, but in clear or partly clear weather the
decrease was more rapid, commencing with 1&deg; for
160 feet near the ground and diminishing to 1&deg; for
1000 feet at an elevation exceeding six miles. The
observations in the captive balloon up to a third of a
mile indicated a daily range in the vertical decrease
of temperature. The observations of relative
humidity agreed with Welsh's in showing a slight
increase up to about half-a-mile, then a decrease
up to above five miles, where there seemed to be
an almost entire absence of water. The other
observations were inconclusive, except that the time
of vibration of a magnet was found to be somewhat
longer than on the earth, which was contrary to
Gay-Lussac's experience. The most remarkable of
Glaisher's ascents was made from Wolverhampton
on September 5, 1862, when in less than one hour
he had passed the altitude of five miles, exceeding
the greatest height hitherto reached. To quote
from Glaisher's narrative: "Up to this time I
had taken observations with comfort and experienced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg_78]</a></span>
no difficulty in breathing, whilst Mr. Coxwell,
in consequence of the exertion he had to
make, had breathed with difficulty for some time.
Having discharged sand, we ascended still higher;
the aspirator became troublesome to work, and I
also found a difficulty in seeing clearly&#8230;.
About 1 hour 52 min., or later, I read the
dry-bulb thermometer as minus 5&deg;; after this I
could not see the column of mercury in the wet-bulb
thermometer, nor the hands of the watch, nor
the fine divisions of any instrument. I asked Mr.
Coxwell to help me to read the instruments. In
consequence, however, of the rotatory motion of
the balloon, which had continued without ceasing
since leaving the earth, the valve-line had become
entangled, and he had to leave the car and mount
into the ring to readjust it. I then looked at the
barometer, and found its reading to be 9&frac34; inches,
still decreasing fast, and implying a height exceeding
29,000 feet. Shortly after, I laid my arm upon
the table, possessed of its full vigour, but on being
desirous of using it, I found it powerless&#8230;. Trying
to move the other arm, I found it powerless
also. Then I tried to shake myself and succeeded,
but I seemed to have no limbs&#8230;. I dimly
saw Mr. Coxwell, and endeavoured to speak, but
could not. In an instant intense darkness overcame
me, so that the optic nerve lost power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg_79]</a></span>
suddenly, but I was still conscious, with as active a
brain as at the present moment whilst writing this.
I thought I had been seized with asphyxia, and
believed I should experience nothing more, as
death would come unless we speedily descended;
other thoughts were entering my mind, when I
suddenly became unconscious&#8230;. I cannot
tell anything of the sense of hearing, as no sound
reaches the air to break the perfect stillness and
silence of the regions between six and seven
miles above the earth. My last observation was
made at 1 hour 54 min., above 29,000 feet&#8230;.
Whilst powerless I heard the words, 'temperature'
and 'observation,' and I knew Mr. Coxwell
was in the car speaking to and endeavouring
to rouse me&#8230;. I then heard him speak
more emphatically, but could not see, speak,
or move. I heard him again say, 'Do try;
now do!' Then the instruments became dimly
visible, then Mr. Coxwell, and very shortly I saw
clearly&#8230;. Mr. Coxwell told me that while in
the ring he felt it piercingly cold, that hoarfrost
was all round the neck of the balloon, and that on
attempting to leave the ring he found his hands
frozen. He had, therefore, to place his arms on
the ring and drop down&#8230;. He wished to
approach me, but could not; and when he felt
insensibility coming over him too, he became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg_80]</a></span>
anxious to open the valve. But in consequence of
having lost the use of his hands he could not do
this; ultimately he succeeded, by seizing the cord
with his teeth, and dipping his head two or three
times, until the balloon took a decided turn downwards.
No inconvenience followed my insensibility;
and when we dropped, it was in a country
where no conveyance of any kind could be
obtained, so I had to walk between seven and
eight miles&#8230;. I have already said that my
last observation was made at a height of 29,000
feet; at this time (1 hour 54 min.) we were
ascending at the rate of 1000 feet per minute; and
when I resumed observations we were descending
at the rate of 2000 feet per minute. These two
positions must be connected, taking into account
the interval of time between, viz. 13 minutes, and
on these considerations the balloon must have
attained the altitude of 36,000 or 37,000 feet.
Again, a very delicate minimum thermometer read
minus 11&deg;.9, and this would give a height of 37,000
feet. Mr. Coxwell, on coming from the ring,
noticed that the centre of the aneroid barometer,
its blue hand, and a rope attached to the car were
all in the same straight line, and this gave a reading
of seven inches and leads to the same result.
Therefore, these independent means all lead to
about the same elevation, viz. fully seven miles."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg_81]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Glaisher's circumstantial evidence of the
height he reached has been assailed lately, partly
from his assumption that the velocity of the balloon
while rising and falling during the thirteen minutes
was uniform, but principally from the supposition
that men could have survived in that region of death,
without at least artificial means of respiration.
While it is certain that Berson's observations, which
are described later, were made at a greater height
than Glaisher's, yet all credit must be given to this
Nestor of aeronautical and meteorological science
in Great Britain, who is still living at the advanced
age of ninety.</p>

<p>The example of Glaisher was not followed in
England, but it stimulated interest in the balloon
again in France, where MM. Flammarion, de
Fonvielle, and Tissandier have made many ascents
for scientific purposes, and have presented the
results in a popular form to the public. Photography
in a balloon is generally a failure on
account of the intense reflection from the upper
cloud surfaces and the haze which masks the earth.
Consequently, for scenic effects we must rely upon
sketches, of which those in that interesting, but
now rather rare book, <i>Travels in the Air</i>, may be
referred to. The high atmosphere is often filled
with fine ice crystals which, though invisible from
below, occasion curious optical phenomena, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg_82]</a></span>
some of these have been sketched by M. Albert
Tissandier, who has the advantage of being an
artist as well as an aeronaut.</p>

<p>Of the many narratives of balloon voyages, one
of the most thrilling is the tragedy of the <i>Zenith</i>.
In 1875, through the co-operation of the French
Academy of Sciences and other scientific bodies, it
was arranged to make two voyages, one of long
duration, the other to a great height, in the balloon
<i>Zenith</i>. The long voyage from Paris to Bordeaux
was successfully accomplished in twenty-four hours,
and on April 15 the <i>Zenith</i> again rose from
Paris, carrying MM. Gaston Tissandier and Croc&eacute;-Spinelli,
with Sivel as aeronaut. By the advice of
M. Paul Bert, the distinguished physiologist, three
small balloons of oxygen were provided to assist
respiration. The scientific apparatus was as
follows: a pump was arranged to draw air
through tubes filled with potash in which to store
the carbonic acid at different heights in the atmosphere,
in order that analysis might determine
if its proportion diminished at great heights; a
spectroscope was employed to examine the line of
water-vapour in the atmosphere, and two aneroid
barometers were provided, one giving the pressure
corresponding to heights up to 13,000 feet, the
other the pressure between 13,000 and 30,000 feet.
There were also two barometric tubes registering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg_83]</a></span>
the lowest pressure, as well as thermometers and
other scientific instruments. At 15,000 feet the
voyagers began to breathe oxygen, which had been
used beneficially by Sivel and Croc&eacute;-Spinelli in
a high ascent the previous year. At 24,000 feet
Tissandier wrote in his notes: "My hands are
freezing. I am well. We are all right. Haze on
horizon with small rounded cirrus. We are rising.
Croc&eacute; pants. We breathe oxygen. Sivel shuts
his eyes, Croc&eacute; does the same." Five minutes
later: "Sivel throws out ballast, temperature
-11&deg; Cent., barometer 300 millimeters." After
this, Tissandier became so weak that he could not
turn his head to look at his companions. He tried
to seize the oxygen tube, but was unable to move
his arms. His mind was clear, and he saw the
barometer sink below 280 millimeters, indicating
a height of 27,000 feet. Then he fainted. After
a half-hour of unconsciousness he revived and
wrote: "We are falling, temperature -8&deg;, barometer
315 millimeters. I discharge ballast. Croc&eacute; and
Sivel unconscious in bottom of basket. We fall
rapidly." Again he fell into a stupor, from which
he was roused by Croc&eacute; shaking his arm, saying,
"Throw out ballast!" which he did, together with
the pump, wraps, etc. What happened after this
is unknown, but probably the balloon, thus lightened
and the gas in it being warm, rose again nearly as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg_84]</a></span>
high as before. When Tissandier came to his
senses the balloon was falling with frightful speed,
and in the bottom of the basket, which was oscillating
violently from side to side, were crouched his
two companions with black faces and bloody
mouths. The shock of striking the ground was
terrific, but the anchor held, and the balloon soon
emptied. From the barometric data it appears
probable that the <i>Zenith</i> attained twice a height
of about 28,000 feet, and that asphyxiation from
the long deprivation of sufficient oxygen killed the
two companions of Tissandier and nearly proved
fatal to him.</p>

<p>This disaster discouraged further attempts to
reach high altitudes, and with the exception of the
ascent to 23,000 feet in France by MM. Jovis and
Mallet, no more were made until the past decade.
The results of the meteorological observations
were seen to be strangely discordant; for example,
the temperature of 40&deg; below zero, observed by
Barral and Bixio at a height of 23,000 feet, and
80&deg; above zero, noted by the American aeronaut
Wise, at 6000 feet. The prophecy "that the
balloon-basket would be the cradle of the young
science of meteorology" seemed unlikely to be
realized, but, nevertheless, observations in balloons
continued to be made in France, Italy, and Russia.
In the United States a series of balloon ascents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg_85]</a></span>
was conducted by the Signal Service, which then
included the Weather Bureau, and the height of
15,500 feet reached by Professor Hazen in 1887
is probably the greatest at which observations in
the free air have been made in America.</p>

<p>The difficulty of obtaining the true temperature
of the air from a balloon is great, and without
special precautions the observations give the conditions
of the free air even less well than do
observations on mountain summits. During a
rapid ascent the air is carried up in the balloon
basket like water in a well-bucket, and since the
balloon drifts with the wind it is relatively in a
calm, so that there is no circulation of air; the
thermometers, even when screened from direct
sunshine, are affected by radiation from the heated
gas-bag above, and moreover they are not sufficiently
sensitive to follow the changing temperature
of the air strata so quickly traversed by
the balloon. The aneroid barometer, from which
the height of the balloon is calculated, cannot
respond to rapid changes of pressure; consequently
there is a double source of error in determining
the height at which the temperature is measured.
Ordinarily, the temperature of the air may be
obtained quite accurately by slinging in a circle
a thermometer attached to a cord, even though
this is done in sunshine. During two balloon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg_86]</a></span>
ascents by the writer, a sling thermometer was
found in extreme cases to read 14&deg; lower than was
recorded by automatic instruments, hung in their
usual position from the ring of the balloon. The
sling thermometer, however, is influenced by
intense insolation, and moreover cannot be swung
far enough outside the basket of a balloon to
insure good results. The standard instrument for
obtaining the temperature of the air under all
conditions, adopted for international use in 1898,
is a modification of that used by Welsh forty-five
years before. This instrument, which is the
invention of Dr. Assmann of Berlin, is called the
aspiration thermometer, and is designed to prevent
the casing surrounding the thermometer from being
heated by insolation or conduction, and to insure
a flow of air past the thermometer bulbs.</p>

<p>The reorganization of balloon observations was
accomplished by the German Society for the
Promotion of A&euml;rial Navigation, which has been
assisted by the Prussian Meteorological Institute,
and by officers of the German Army Balloon
Corps. The German Emperor takes a personal
interest in the work, and has aided it by the gift of
a considerable sum of money. The first voyage
under the direction of the Society was made in
1888, and many notable ones followed. In 1891,
through the courtesy of the president, Dr. Assmann,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg_87]</a></span>
the writer made an ascent from Berlin in a balloon
equipped for accurate observations, with the special
purpose of comparing the sling with the aspiration
thermometer. The car of the balloon is shown in
<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>. A companion was the now famous Dr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg_88]</a></span>
Berson, who then made his second ascent, but who
has now become an expert aeronaut by reason of
more than fifty ascensions, some of them to great
heights. On December 4, 1894, he ascended alone
from Stassfurt, Prussia, in the <i>Ph&#339;nix</i>, to probably
the greatest height ever reached by man, at least
in a conscious state. By breathing oxygen he was
able to keep his senses and to read the barometer
at 9&middot;1 inches, indicating approximately an altitude
of 30,000 feet, and the aspirated thermometer at
54&deg; below zero. An ordinary thermometer read
11&deg; below zero in the sun, showing its heat was
much diminished in consequence of the haze that
prevailed even at this enormous height. The
cirriform clouds which surrounded the balloon were
found to have the structure of snow-flakes rather
than that of ice-crystals. The chief result of this
record-breaking ascent was the extraordinarily low
temperatures recorded at great heights, as compared
with those observed by Glaisher, Tissandier,
and others. An inversion of temperature&mdash;that is
an increase of temperature with height&mdash;prevailed
up to a mile, but above that the temperature fell at
a rapid and accelerated rate which approached the
adiabatic fall above 26,000 feet. The wind, which
was almost calm at the earth's surface, increased
to a gale in the high atmosphere, and carried the
balloon along at an average speed of thirty-six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg_89]</a></span>
miles an hour. Wishing to demonstrate conclusively
whether the insular position of England
influenced the temperature of the high atmosphere,
as had been suggested, Dr. Berson determined to
execute a high ascension in England during the
prevalence of a barometric maximum in summer,
when the air column would be abnormally warmed
and the upper isothermal surfaces elevated. An
opportunity was afforded Berson to follow in
Glaisher's footsteps on September 14, 1898, when
abnormal heat prevailed in Europe. Berson, with
the aeronaut Spencer, in the balloon <i>Excelsior</i>, rose
from the Crystal Palace in London to the height
of 27,300 feet, where he observed a temperature of
-29&deg;. The oxygen inhaled prevented harmful
physiological effects except for the discomfort
caused by the enormous reduction of temperature
from 80&deg; at the ground only thirty-five minutes
before. The temperature decreased rapidly at first,
then moderately up to three miles, and above that
it fell almost at the adiabatic rate. Even in this hot
summer maximum of pressure and notwithstanding
the maritime climate and south-westerly currents,
a temperature about 29&deg; below zero reigned at
27,000 feet, being only a few degrees warmer than
Berson had observed in winter at the same height
above Germany. Yet Glaisher, in all his ascents,
two of which exceeded 26,000 feet, never recorded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg_90]</a></span>
a temperature of less than 5&deg; below zero.
These relatively high temperatures, obtained also
by Welsh, Tissandier, and Gay-Lussac, must be
attributed to the insufficient protection of the
thermometers against insolation, to the proximity
of the instruments to the heated basket and its
occupants, and lastly, to the sluggishness of the
thermometers themselves, from lack of ventilation,
during the rapid passage through air-strata of
different temperatures. <a href="#Plate_VI">Plate VI</a>. indicates the
change of temperature with height observed during

<p>This account of notable balloon ascents should
not be closed without mentioning the most daring
and unique of all, the voyage of Mr. S. A. Andr&eacute;e
towards the north pole in 1897. Although his was
a voyage of geographical discovery, and not one for
the exploration of the air, yet meteorological and
other observations were to be made, and Andr&eacute;e
had familiarized himself with the instruments and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg_91]</a></span>
the management of a balloon during several
voyages in Sweden. The success of the polar
voyage depended primarily upon the prevalence
of southerly winds, and the ability of the balloon
to keep afloat long enough to profit by them, even
should they be light and variable at times. Therefore
the impermeability of the balloon to hydrogen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg_92]</a></span>
gas was of vital importance, and it was the conviction
that the <i>Eagle</i>, of 140,000 cubic feet, was
neither sufficiently large nor staunch to sustain
itself for thirty days, the time which might be
required to reach Behring Straits, that led Dr. Nils
Ekholm, the meteorologist and physicist, to withdraw
from the expedition. Unfortunately, his fears
seem to have been well founded, and it is probable
that we must now abandon hope of the safety of
the brave Andr&eacute;e and his two companions.</p>

<p>A less perilous voyage northward across the
Alps was attempted in 1898 by Professor Heim,
the Swiss geologist, and two associates, conducted
by the Italian aeronaut, Spelterini. With an
automatic photographic camera, similar to one
described in the next chapter, it was hoped to get
views of the high Alps from above, which would
be alike valuable for geologic and topographic
study. Extensive meteorological observations were
made in connection with the sixth international
balloon ascent, but only the Jura was crossed, at
an altitude of 13,000 feet, because the balloon
travelled in a north-westerly direction, instead of
north-east as was expected.</p>

<p>Many years ago Wise and Donaldson, the
American aeronauts, proposed to cross the Atlantic
Ocean in a balloon. The difficulties which present
themselves in such an undertaking are purely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg_93]</a></span>
technical, and given a balloon which loses its gas
so slowly that its buoyancy can be maintained for
several days, there seems to be no reason why such
a balloon, at a height of four or five miles, could
not pass from San Francisco to New York, or from
the United States to Europe, since the motion of
the upper clouds proves that the high atmosphere
moves almost constantly with great velocity from
the west to the east. The dirigible balloon has not
been realized except in nearly calm weather, but
the aeronaut can often reverse his direction by
ascending or descending into a contrary wind to
that in which he has been travelling. Frequently
no clouds separate these opposing currents, which
become apparent only when a balloon enters them.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that in 1869 Glaisher
made observations in a captive balloon in England
up to the height of 1700 feet in order to study the
conditions of the air within this distance of the
earth, which could not be done in a free and
rapidly moving balloon. Although captive balloons
are frequently used in the European cities to lift
people who wish to enjoy the view from a height
of 500 or 1000 feet, they appear to have been little
used by scientific observers since the time of
Glaisher. In 1890-91 the aeronautical society at
Berlin employed a captive balloon in connection
with the observations in free balloons which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg_94]</a></span>
been described. This captive balloon had a
capacity of only 5000 cubic feet, but it sufficed to
lift an apparatus weighing sixteen pounds, designed
by Dr. Assmann to record atmospheric pressure, as
well as the temperature and relative humidity of
the air. The balloon, attached to a cable 2600 feet
long, was drawn down by a steam engine. It was
possible in this way to have simultaneous observations
at three levels, viz. near the ground, in the
free air at a height of about half-a-mile, and at the
highest level attained by a free balloon. But the
captive balloon is often at a disadvantage, for the
wind drives it down, and although the meteorograph
mentioned had ingenious devices to neutralize the
violent shocks caused by this and by the rebound
of the balloon after the gust of wind, yet these
impaired the automatic record. The height to
which the balloon rose was so much diminished
by the wind that instead of 2600 feet, which the
balloon attained in calm weather when the cable
was vertical, the average height of the twenty-four
ascents was but half this, and in very windy
weather the balloon could not rise at all.</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;German Kite-balloon.
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To obviate these difficulties, a few years ago
there was invented by two officers of the German
army, Lieutenants von Siegsfeld and von Parseval,
a captive balloon capable of resisting strong
winds, called, from its action as a kite, the <i>Drachen-Ballon</i>
or kite-balloon, and which at the present
time is being successfully used in the German
Army and Navy for reconnoitring in all kinds
of weather. A smaller kite-balloon, of 7700 cubic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg_96]</a></span>
feet capacity, filled either with hydrogen or with
illuminating gas, was first used to lift meteorological
instruments at Strassburg in 1898, where
it remained at a height of several hundred feet
during twenty-four hours. As is seen from <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>,
the balloon is cylindrical, with hemispherical ends,
and is attached to its cable like a kite, so that
the wind acts to lift and not to depress it.
The cylinder is divided by a diaphragm near its
lower end into two chambers, the upper and
larger one being filled with gas, while the lower
chamber, by means of a valve opening inwards,
receives the pressure of the wind which presses
against the diaphragm, and preserves the sausage-like
form of the balloon in spite of leakage of
gas. Another wind-bag encircling the bottom
of the air-chamber serves as a rudder, and lateral
fins or wings give stability to the balloon about
its longer axis. The instruments are placed in a
basket hung far below the balloon. In cases
where there is little or no wind at the ground,
captive balloons can render valuable service for
meteorological observations, but in all other cases
kites are preferable. The reasons for this assertion
will be given when we consider kites.</p>

<p>From what has been said it will be perceived
how much the Germans did to advance scientific
ballooning, yet their constant rivals, the French,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg_97]</a></span>
found a way to surpass them in the exploration of
the atmosphere. For several years the struggle for
supremacy in the attainment of the greatest heights
was keen between the scientific men of both
countries, but a truce was declared at Paris in 1896,
and since then both nations have worked together
harmoniously. The friendly meeting of French
and German physicists at Strassburg in 1898 to
agree upon the details of co-operation, typified the
union of nations through science, and while it is
true that the atmosphere has no boundaries and
cannot be pre-empted, let us hope that the common
aims of science will ultimately obliterate even
political boundaries.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><i>BALLONS-SONDES</i> FOR GREAT ALTITUDES&mdash;THE
INTERNATIONAL ASCENTS</div>


<p>We have seen that the ascent of human beings
to heights of six miles is attended with difficulty
and danger, and even with apparatus for supplying
the life-sustaining oxygen, man can hardly hope
to reach much greater altitudes. Consequently,
to obtain information about the atmospheric strata
lying above six miles, that is to say, those facts
which require to be ascertained in the medium
itself, we must employ the so-called <i>ballons-sondes</i>,
carrying self-recording instruments but no observers.
This method, which was proposed in Copenhagen
as long ago as 1809, was first put into execution
by the French aeronauts, Hermite and Besan&ccedil;on,
who, it may be remarked, suggested attempting
to reach the North Pole by balloon some time
before Andr&eacute;e announced his scheme.</p>

<p>A balloon is the best of anemometers, since it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg_99]</a></span>
takes the direction and speed of the currents in
which it floats, and hence it is customary, before
a manned balloon starts, to dispatch several small
pilot-balloons in order to judge of the direction
and strength of the upper winds. Even if we do
not know the height of the currents in which they
float, though this can be ascertained by measuring
the height of the balloon trigonometrically or
micrometrically, we still obtain a general knowledge
of the direction and speed of the currents.
With this idea, M. Bonvallet in 1891 dispatched
from Amiens, France, ninety-seven paper balloons,
each provided with a postal card asking for the
time and place of descent. Sixty of these cards
were returned, almost all the balloons having been
carried east by the upper current, ten going beyond
one hundred and thirty miles, and one travelling
at a speed of almost one hundred miles an hour.</p>

<p>The next year the experiment was continued
by MM. Hermite and Besan&ccedil;on with balloons of
thirty-five cubic feet contents, and about half of
those dispatched from Paris were recovered within
a radius of one hundred miles. The height to
which the balloons could rise is determined by
the following considerations: to ascend 18,000
feet, where the atmospheric pressure is one-half
that at the earth (see <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>.), the balloon when
half full of gas must lift itself from the ground;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg_100]</a></span>
to rise 35,000 feet, where the pressure is reduced
to one-quarter, it must be able to start upward
when one-quarter filled, and so on. In practice
the ascensional force usually diminishes at first
from various causes, such as the escape of gas, its
cooling, and the deposit of moisture on the outside
of the balloon. To penetrate the clouds, therefore,
it is necessary to have a considerable excess of
ascensional force, but above the clouds, since the
heating effect of the sun increases greatly with
altitude, the gas in the balloon is warmed much
above the surrounding air, and so the theoretical
altitudes are exceeded.</p>

<div class="justify">Having determined that balloons inflated with
one hundred and fifty cubic feet of coal-gas would
rise to great heights, simple and light registering
instruments, as well as the postal cards, were
attached to them. As the pressure diminished,
an aneroid barometer traced a line on a smoked
glass, and after the descent was placed under the
receiver of an air-pump, and the pressure required
to reproduce the trace was measured by a manometer.
From this the height could be computed
approximately. The maximum and minimum
thermometer was of the well-known U-form, and
instructions appended asked that it be read as
soon as found. A slow-match was arranged to
detach postal cards successively, so that if they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg_101]</a></span>
were found and mailed, the track of the balloon
could be determined. These balloons at first were
called <i>ballons perdus</i>, or lost balloons, but when it
was known that most of the fourteen balloons
liberated from Paris were recovered, the name
<i>ballons explorateurs</i> was given, which was afterwards
changed to <i>ballons-sondes</i>, or sounding balloons.
The Germans call them, <i>Registrir-Ballons</i>, and in
English they have been designated unmanned
balloons also. One of these paper balloons having
reached a height of nearly 30,000 feet, MM.
Hermite and Besan&ccedil;on proceeded to construct
a balloon of gold-beater's skin, having a capacity
of 3960 cubic feet, in order to carry a better
instrumental equipment. The self-recording instruments
made by the French firm of Richard
Brothers were well adapted for this purpose, and
a combined barometer and thermometer, registering
in ink on an upright drum that is turned by clockwork
inside, is shown in <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>. The exhausted
pair of boxes B of the barometer actuates the
lower pen, while the curved tube C, which is filled
with alcohol, by its change of shape moves the
upper pen and records the temperature. From
the indications of the barometer and the temperature
of the mass of air, it is possible by Laplace's
formula to calculate the height at any hour of the
registration. The balloon mentioned was the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg_102]</a></span>
of the so-called <i>A&eacute;rophiles</i>, and when inflated with
coal-gas it could lift seventy-seven pounds besides
its own weight of forty pounds. It carried two of
the baro-thermographs described, and a package
of information cards arranged to be detached by
a slow-match. To mitigate the shock of striking
the ground one of the instruments was hung by
rubber cords inside a wicker basket that in the
first ascent was not screened from the sun. It was

<span class="figcaption"><span class="sc">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Baro-thermograph of Richard.</span>
</div>

decided to liberate these balloons entirely filled with
gas (instead of partly full, to allow for its expansion),
and to utilize all possible ascensional force at
first rather than to weight the balloon with an
automatic discharger of ballast (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>). The trial
of the <i>A&eacute;rophile</i> occurred March 21, 1893, and
the next day one of the cards was returned announcing
its fall in the department of the Yonne,
where the balloon and the instruments were recovered
injured. From the blurred traces of the
latter it was computed that at an altitude of about
49,000 feet a temperature of -60&deg; Fahrenheit had
been met with, both pressure and temperature
being the lowest measured in a balloon up to that
time. Although the data secured by this ascent
were somewhat doubtful, yet the feasibility of
exploring the atmosphere by <i>ballons-sondes</i> was
proved. It was seen that the enormous velocity
of ascent overcame the wind and permitted the
path of the balloon to the summit of its trajectory
to be followed, the balloon appearing like a meteor
visible in daylight, and so its height could be
calculated by trigonometrical measurements; while
the descent, caused by the escape and cooling of
the gas, was gentle and regular, permitting the
delicate instruments to be recovered uninjured.</div>

<p>The second ascent of this <i>A&eacute;rophile</i> was its last,
for, after falling in the Black Forest, it was burned
by children. However, M. Besan&ccedil;on, not discouraged,
constructed the <i>A&eacute;rophile II.</i> of 6300
cubic feet, and improved the instruments as experience
suggested. The records had often been
interrupted by freezing of the ink, so the pen was
replaced by a needle marking with less friction on
smoked paper surrounding the record drum. To
avoid heating of the thermometers by the sun, they
were placed in a wicker cylinder open at both
ends and covered with bright metallic paper.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg_105]</a></span>
This was hung below the balloon with its axis
vertical, in order that the draught through the
cylinder when the balloon was rising or falling
should counteract the insolation, and in the next
ascent, at about the same altitude, a temperature
lower by 36&deg; Fahrenheit indicated the effect of the
protection. To secure an independent record of
the lowest temperature an ingenious device was
used, consisting of a thermometer tube filled with
alcohol and having black divisions. The lowest
point to which the alcohol sank was recorded on
photographic paper placed behind the tube, the
whole being enclosed in a metallic box that was
automatically closed on striking the ground, and
so was preserved against the meddling of curious
persons. Up to the middle of 1898 ten voyages had
been made by the <i>A&eacute;rophiles</i>, which were now constructed
of varnished silk to hold 16,000 cubic feet
of gas.</p>

<p>One of the objects sought was the collection of
samples of air at great heights, but this was not
accomplished until recently. In the first apparatus
for this purpose, an aneroid barometer at a predetermined
pressure turned the cock communicating
with an exhausted receiver that filled with air and
was then closed. The cock leaked, so next the
ingenious device of generating heat chemically to
seal the glass tube was tried. This, too, failed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg_106]</a></span>
but finally, an apparatus of M. Cailletet solved the
problem. It is advisable to control the height
deduced from the barometric records by direct
observations so long as the balloon remains visible,
and for this purpose micrometric measures were
made with a telescope as soon as the balloon left
the ground. There was also used a species of
registering theodolite which, when kept pointed
at the balloon, automatically traced on paper its
azimuth and angular altitude. These records, when
combined with the barometric height at a known
hour, permitted the horizontal distance traversed,
and hence the velocity, to be calculated, or, with
two such instruments at ends of a base line, the
height of the balloon could be found.</p>

<p>The first experiments with <i>ballons-sondes</i> in
France were soon repeated in Germany, where a
balloon of rubber-fabric holding 8700 cubic feet
was obtained by the German Society for the
Promotion of A&euml;rial Navigation. When inflated
with coal-gas it had a lifting force of about two
hundred and ninety pounds, in excess of its
envelope, etc., weighing ninety-three pounds, and
the meteorological apparatus weighing six pounds.
The <i>Cirrus</i>, as it was called, burst on its first trial,
but in July 1894 it made a remarkable voyage
from Berlin to the boundary of Bosnia, a distance
of seven hundred miles, at an average speed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg_107]</a></span>
sixty-two miles an hour. A maximum height of
54,000 feet and a minimum temperature of -63&deg;
Fahrenheit were recorded. The <i>Cirrus</i> on its third
voyage was accompanied by manned balloons in
order to have simultaneous observations at different
levels, and this time it travelled eighty-three miles
an hour and rose 61,000 feet. The lowest temperature
of -88&deg; Fahrenheit was supposed to be too
high, for the reason that whereas the ventilation
of the thermometers in a rapidly ascending or
descending balloon might be sufficient to counteract
solar radiation, this would not be the case
when the balloon was approaching its culminating
point with a diminishing speed. Therefore, Dr.
Assmann, under whose supervision the German experiments
were conducted, employed the thermometer,
which in the captive balloon was aspirated
electrically, but now was driven by a weight, and
later, because the ink froze, the registration was
made photographic. The efficacy of the aspirator
was seen in the ascent referred to, for, when its
action stopped, a higher temperature was recorded
though the balloon continued to ascend. In April
1895 the <i>Cirrus</i> rose to the extraordinary height
of 72,000 feet, or more than thirteen and a quarter
miles, where the barometric pressure was reduced
to one and a half inches of mercury. (In <a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a>.
this extreme and possibly excessive height is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg_108]</a></span>
shown as the height of the <i>ballon-sonde</i>, but the
average of the three highest ascents of the <i>Cirrus</i>
is indicated.) The comparative warmth (-50&deg;
Fahrenheit) recorded has led Dr. Assmann himself
to doubt the accuracy of the usual methods
of registering temperature at such extremely low
pressures. <a href="#Plate_VII">Plate VII</a>. shows the heights in metres,
and the temperatures in degrees Centigrade, during
eight voyages from Berlin prior to June 1897.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the rivalry and difference of
opinion between the Germans and French as to
the methods of exploring the high atmosphere,
there was also a sincere desire to co-operate, and
the International Meteorological Conference which
was held at Paris in September 1896 furnished an
opportunity to make the arrangements. Resolutions
were adopted favouring ascents with manned
balloons, as well as simultaneous ascents of <i>ballons-sondes</i>
in the different countries. The successful
use of kites at Blue Hill to lift self-recording
instruments more than a mile into the air led
to the wish that similar experiments should be
tried elsewhere. An International Committee
was appointed to carry out these resolutions, of
which Professor Hergesell of Strassburg is president,
and the veteran Parisian aeronaut and
journalist, Wilfrid de Fonvielle, is secretary.</p>

<p>It was agreed to make a night ascent and to use
identical instruments, in order that the observations
might be made everywhere under the same conditions.
Accordingly, on the early morning of
November 14, 1896, five balloons manned by
observers, and three <i>ballons-sondes</i> with recording
instruments, were liberated in France, Germany,
and Russia. By means of the automatic diagrams
from the <i>ballons-sondes</i>, and the direct observations
in the manned balloons, it was sought to determine
the decrease of temperature with height in vertical
sections of the atmosphere connecting the various
centres from which the balloons started. Seven
such sections were available by connecting Paris
and Strassburg, Berlin and St. Petersburg, Warsaw
and Munich, etc., but, unfortunately, observations
in the highest strata were generally lacking.</p>

<p>Three more international ascents were made
during the year 1897, which were participated in
less extensively. At this time it was necessary to
decide questions that had arisen, and to make
plans for the future, consequently a meeting of the
International Committee was held at Strassburg
in 1898. Many technical questions were settled,
but the chief result accomplished was the dissipation
of misunderstandings and prejudices, not only between
French and Germans, but between the German
representatives themselves, for no doubt personal
intercourse is the greatest good of such conferences.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg_111]</a></span>
Although it was not a surprise, nevertheless it was
regretted that no one came from Great Britain,
where, since Glaisher's epoch-making balloon ascensions,
little has been done to explore the air. The
beneficial results of the Conference were apparent
at the fifth international ascent, which occurred in
the early morning of June 8, 1898. Austria and
Belgium joined Germany, France, and Russia, and
the field of atmospheric survey was extended over
a good part of Europe. A veritable aeronautic fleet
was launched from Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Warsaw,
St. Petersburg, Strassburg, Munich, and Vienna,
consisting of twenty-one balloons, of which thirteen
carried observers, who all used the aspiration
thermometers, and eight were equipped only with
self-recording instruments. Some of the latter
balloons reached altitudes of 50,000 feet, and the
former attained extreme heights of one-third this.
On the day selected the atmosphere was in a state
of repose, with light variable winds, except high
up, where they blew, as is usual, from the west or
south-west. These observations were sufficiently
numerous to form a synoptic chart at a considerable
height above Europe for comparison with the
usual chart drawn from the surface observations.</p>

<p>Besides the general work of the International
Committee, special investigations have been undertaken
by the French, who formed an Aerostatic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg_112]</a></span>
Commission in Paris. The services of the eminent
physicists, MM. Cailletet and <a name="Violle_1"></a><a href="#CORRIGENDA">Violle</a>, have been
enlisted, while a generous patron has been found
in Prince Roland Bonaparte. The apparatus of
M. Cailletet to bring down samples of air from
the high regions may now be described. When
the balloon has reached its greatest height a cock
of special construction, turned by clockwork, opens
and allows the air to enter a reservoir in which a
vacuum exists, and then the cock is automatically
and hermetically closed. As it is known that
the balloon reaches its extreme height in about
an hour and a quarter, the time of opening the
cock is so regulated, the closing taking place a
little later by its further rotation. In order to
protect the moving parts from the extreme cold, a
receptacle filled with fused acetate of soda is
placed in the box containing the motor, so that,
notwithstanding the intense cold of the high regions,
this salt in assuming a crystalline state gives out
enough heat during several hours at least. During
the ascent of an <i>A&eacute;rophile</i> air was collected at
50,000 feet, which when analyzed by M. <a name="Muntz_1"></a><a href="#CORRIGENDA">M&uuml;ntz</a>
showed what was supposed, viz. that at this altitude
the composition of the air does not differ much
from that of the lower air. The slight excess of
carbonic acid found in the upper air might be due
to the oxidation of the grease used on the cock,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg_113]</a></span>
and the smaller quantity of oxygen, as compared
with normal air, might be caused by the absorption
of this gas by the grease or even the absorption by
the tinned sides of the copper reservoir. By eliminating
all possible sources of error in future
ascensions, M. <a name="Muntz_2"></a><a href="#CORRIGENDA">M&uuml;ntz</a> thinks that it can be proved
whether there are real differences in the air at
different heights, for the methods of analysis are
to-day accurate enough to show such differences if
they exist. But since it is probable that in the
regions which can be explored by the <i>ballons-sondes</i>,
the air undergoes the same mixing that
renders the lower air nearly uniform, only the
smallest variations in its composition would naturally
be found, requiring minute precautions against
errors. This is no doubt why previous measures
agreed in showing the invariable composition of
the air at lower altitudes.</p>

<p>Another important contribution of M. Cailletet
is an apparatus for measuring the height of the
balloon by photography in order to verify Laplace's
formula connecting the barometric pressure with
the altitude. The idea was to replace the observers
on the ground, who sometimes made the trigonometrical
measurements of the balloon described,
by a photographic apparatus carried by the
balloon itself, and which at frequent intervals
should photograph automatically the ground over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg_114]</a></span>
which it passed, at the same time that an aneroid
barometer was photographed on the same sheet.
The apparatus is hung vertically below the balloon;
in the lower portion of the box is an objective
which photographs the ground, and in the upper
portion is a second objective which photographs
the face of an aneroid barometer placed at the
proper distance above. A clock-movement makes
exposures every two minutes, and a sensitive film
unrolled between the objectives receives the images
on each side. If there are known, the focal length
of the objective, the distance of two points on the
ground, and the distance of two points on the
photograph, a simple proportion permits the height
of the balloon to be determined at that time, and
consequently, from the barometric record, the law
connecting the pressure with height can be deduced.
The apparatus was successfully used in the voyage
of a large balloon with observers, and the accuracy
of the determination of height was found to be
within <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>250</sub>. If the apparatus is to be used at
great heights it would be necessary to protect
the barometer and the camera from the very low
temperatures. Besides the use for which it was
designed, this apparatus may serve to trace the
route of a balloon and to determine the horizontal
velocity at the different points of its path.</p>

<p>The exploration of the high atmosphere by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg_115]</a></span>
<i>ballons-sondes</i>, which can aid so many investigations,
has been utilized by M. <a name="Violle_2"></a><a href="#CORRIGENDA">Violle</a> to obtain actinometric
measures, that is, to determine the amount of
heat given by the sun, or what is called the "solar
constant." This has been done on mountains with
varying results, due to the changing amount of
atmospheric absorption. In regions traversed by
the balloon where the pressure of the air is reduced
to a few inches of mercury, where there is a complete
absence of water-vapour, and at heights to
which terrestrial dust does not extend, the measure
of the quantity of heat sent by the sun towards
the earth is freed from almost all the errors which
we encounter on its surface. The actinometer of
M. <a href="#CORRIGENDA">Violle</a> is, in principle, a sphere of copper,
blackened externally, and having inside a thermometric
apparatus which registers some distance
away. Under the action of the solar rays the
sphere is heated, and assumes equilibrium when
the loss by radiation and by contact with the
air compensates for the gain by the absorption
of the direct heat. While at low levels the
atmosphere also contributes to heat the sphere,
at great heights the sun shines from an almost
black sky and alone heats the sphere. Since the
balloon follows the wind the apparatus is protected
from air currents which would otherwise introduce
errors. Each twenty minutes a screen cuts off the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg_116]</a></span>
solar rays from the sphere so that it cools to the
temperature of the air, which is also recorded. On
account of its weight this apparatus has not yet
been carried by a <i>ballon-sonde</i>, but it has operated
successfully in a balloon with observers.</p>

<p>M. Teisserenc de Bort, who is actively engaged
in exploring the air from a meteorological standpoint,
has constructed a very sensitive thermometer
made of a blade of German silver set in a frame of
nickel-steel that does not expand with heat. This
may be ventilated by a fan, and, while extremely
sensitive to changes of temperature, it is not affected
by shocks, and consequently is well adapted for
use in <i>ballons-sondes</i> that pass rapidly through air-strata
of varying temperature.</p>

<p>From this review of the development of the
<i>ballons-sondes</i> it is evident that they offer possibilities
of obtaining data in the high atmosphere,
perhaps up to fifteen miles or more, which, though
subject to inaccuracies, are of great interest to the
physicist and astronomer. The meteorologist is
chiefly concerned with that portion of the atmosphere
which lies within two or three miles of the
earth, and he requires, moreover, accurate measurements
for his conclusions. The new and most
satisfactory way of obtaining these data is by kites,
and the remaining chapters will treat of this method
of exploring the atmosphere and the results.</p>

<div class="blockquot">KITES&mdash;HISTORY AND APPLICATION TO METEOROLOGICAL
PURPOSES AT BLUE HILL AND ELSEWHERE</div>


<p>Kites are supposed to have been invented four
hundred years before the Christian era by Archytas,
and at Smyrna the flying of kites remains a
national sport to this day. We are told that
two hundred years later, a Chinese general, Han
Sin, employed kites as a means of communication
with the garrison of a besieged town, and
there is a legend about their use in Japan to dislodge
and carry away a golden ornament from a
tower. Whatever may be the truth of these stories,
we know that kite-flying in the Malay Archipelago,
in China, and in Japan, has been a pastime for
all classes during centuries, and that the Asiatic
people have always been the expert kite-fliers of
the world.</p>

<p>Kites with tails seem to have been introduced
into England about two hundred and fifty years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg_118]</a></span>
ago, and Isaac Newton when a school-boy made
some improvements in them. Notwithstanding
the fact that generations of boys have flown kites
and so eminent a mathematician as Euler investigated
their theory, until recently kites remained
toys unsuited for practical purposes. Since the
tailless kite has become a familiar object, it has
been said facetiously that kites lost their tails by
the same process of evolution which deprived man
of his caudal appendage; but as kites without
tails have been flown in Asia for centuries, the
truth is that the tailed kites were the ones first
brought to Europe as playthings. To-day in
Holland we see boys flying the English bow-kite
and the common kite with crossed sticks, both of
which require tails, and by the side of them tailless
kites imported from the Dutch colonies in Java.
<a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a> represents a kite from the east coast
of Java, drawn from a model in a museum at
Amsterdam, and also a drawing of a Chinese bird-kite
in the National Museum at Washington. Like
most of the oriental kites, they are made flat, but
when exposed to the wind the extremities of the
wings, which have a frame of split bamboo, bend
backward, securing in this way the stability which
in our common flat kite is gained by the action of
the tail in lowering the centre of gravity and in
maintaining the inclination to the wind.</p>

<p>From historical researches that have been stimulated
by the recent practical applications of kites,
it appears that their first use for scientific purposes
was in 1749, when Dr. Alexander Wilson of Glasgow,
and his pupil, Thomas Melvill, used kites to
lift thermometers. Their kites, from four to seven
feet in height, and covered with paper, were fastened
behind one another, each kite taking up as much
line as could be supported, thereby allowing its
companion to soar to an elevation proportionally
higher. It is related that "the uppermost one
ascended to an amazing height, disappearing at
times among the white summer clouds, whilst all
the rest, in a series, formed with it in the air below
such a lofty scale, and that too affected by such
regular and conspiring motions, as at once changed
a boyish pastime into a spectacle which greatly
interested every beholder&#8230;. To obtain the information
they wanted they contrived that thermometers,
properly secured, and having bushy tassels
of paper tied to them, should be let fall at stated
periods from some of the higher kites, which was
accomplished by the gradual singeing of a match-line."
How the thermometers were prevented
from changing their readings while falling to the
ground is not explained. The account concludes:
"When engaged in these experiments, though now
and then they communicated immediately with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg_121]</a></span>
the clouds, yet, as this happened always in fine
weather, no symptoms whatever of an electrical
nature came under their observation. The sublime
analysis of the thunderbolt, and of the electricity
of the atmosphere, lay yet entirely undiscovered,
and was reserved two years longer for the sagacity
of the celebrated Dr. Franklin." Hence it seems
that Franklin's famous experiment of collecting
the electricity of a thunder-cloud by means of a
kite, performed at Philadelphia in 1752, was not
its first scientific application, and therefore America
can claim only the later and most remarkable
development of this means of exploring the air.</p>

<p>About 1837 there existed in Philadelphia an
organization called the Franklin Kite Club that
flew kites for recreation. Espy, the eminent
meteorologist, was a member, and he states "that
on those days when columnar clouds form rapidly
and numerously the kite was frequently carried
upward nearly perpendicularly by columns of ascending
air," a phenomenon which is often observed
to-day. Espy calculated the height at which
clouds should form by the cooling of the air to its
dew-point, and then employed kites to verify his
calculations of the heights of the clouds. It will
be remembered that both these methods are utilized
in the measurements of cloud-heights at Blue Hill.
Kites were employed to get temperatures a hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg_122]</a></span>
or more feet above the Arctic ocean early in the
present century, and in 1847 W. R. Birt flew a
kite at Kew Observatory, with which he hoped to
obtain measures of temperature, humidity, wind
velocity, etc. This kite, hexagonal in shape,
required three divergent strings attached to the
ground to keep it steady, and the instruments were
to be hoisted up to the kite by a pulley.</p>

<p>Perhaps the first person to soar aloft on a kite
was a lady, who, more than fifty years ago, was
lifted some hundred feet by a great kite constructed
by George Pocock, an Englishman, to serve as an
a&euml;rial observatory in warfare, and also to drag
carriages along the ground. It was proposed
afterwards to make use of kites in shipwrecks to
take persons or life-lines ashore, and in 1865 Sir
George Nares invented a storm-kite, so called, with
a tail made up of hollow cones. This form of tail,
subsequently used for both kites and balloons, is
very efficient, since it offers increasing resistance
as the wind becomes stronger.</p>

<p>In 1882 Mr. Douglas Archibald in England
revived the use of kites for meteorological observations,
and outlined a comprehensive scheme of
exploring the air with kites which included almost
all that has been done since, but his actual work,
performed during the next three years, was limited
to ascertaining the increase of wind velocity with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg_123]</a></span>
height. To do this, he attached registering anemometers
at four different points on the kite-wire,
but since the total wind movements only
were registered from the time the anemometers
left the ground until they returned, it was impossible
to obtain simultaneous records near the
ground and at the kite, as is done to-day. Still,
Archibald got differential measurements of the
velocity of the wind up to the height of 1200 feet.
The kites he employed were diamond-shaped,
covered with silk, and were flown tandem, with
the hollow cones, already mentioned, attached to
the tails. Although copper and iron wire had
been used for flying kites many years before, yet
Archibald was the first to substitute steel pianoforte
wire for the string, thereby increasing the
strength while diminishing the weight, size, and
cost of the line. Mr. Archibald in 1887 took the
first photograph from a kite, a method which MM.
Batut and Wenz developed in France, and Messrs.
Eddy and Woglom in the United States.</p>

<p>The subsequent progress of kite-flying for
meteorological purposes has taken place in the
last-named country, and may be chronologically
stated as follows: in 1885 Mr. Alexander McAdie
(later of the U. S. Weather Bureau) repeated
Franklin's kite experiment on Blue Hill, with the
addition of an electrometer; in <a name="date1891"></a><a href="#CORRIGENDA">1891</a>, and again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg_124]</a></span>
in 1892, he measured simultaneously the electric
potential at the base of Blue Hill, on the hill, and
with kites as collectors several hundred feet above
the hill-top, about the same time that Dr. Weber,
in Breslau, Germany, was making a more extensive
use of kites for the same purpose. It was no
doubt William A. Eddy of Bayonne, N. J., who
turned the attention of American scientific men
to kite-flying, and created the widespread interest
in kites which exists to-day. About 1890 Mr.
Eddy lifted thermometers with an ordinary kite,
but soon afterwards devised a tailless kite, resembling
the Java kite except that the horizontal
cross-piece is nearer the top of the vertical stick,
and its ends are bent backward in a bow and connected
by a cord. This kite starts upward on
being held in the wind at the end of a taut line,
and continues to rise until the increasing wind-pressure
on the portion above the cross-stick
balances the pressure on the larger lower portion.
The kite is kept from falling to one side by the
looseness of the covering on either side of the backbone,
and if there is more material on one side
than on the other, or if the covering is too tight
to form pockets in the wind, the kite requires a tail.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> A tail will prevent any kite from turning over, or
"diving," because its weight keeps the lower end down
while the pressure of the wind on the tail also pulls the lower
end backward and maintains the necessary angle of the kite
to the wind, the most efficient angle being about 22 degrees.
Bending back the ends of the cross-stick gives stability to a
kite because, when, on account of the eddies in the wind, a
stronger pressure is exerted on one side of the kite, this side
is driven backward, thereby presenting less effective surface
to the wind, while as the other side comes forward more
nearly at right angles to the wind, it receives greater pressure
than before. In this way the equilibrium about the central
stick is automatically maintained, the required inclination to
the wind being secured by the greater surface presented to
the wind below the point of attachment of the bridle.</div>

<p>In 1891 Mr. Eddy lifted a minimum thermometer
by several of these kites flown tandem, and
proposed to obtain in this way data to forecast
the weather. In the <i>Proceedings of the Aeronautical
Conference</i>, held in connection with the Chicago
Exposition, Prof. M. W. Harrington, then Chief
of the U. S. Weather Bureau, quoted Mr. Eddy's
estimate of the cost of exploring the air by means
of kites flown in series, and advocated their use.</p>

<p>Up to this time it does not appear that self-recording
instruments&mdash;that is to say, those which
make continuous graphic records&mdash;had been raised
by kites. In the days of the early experimenters
such instruments were too heavy and cumbersome
to be lifted by the more or less unmanageable
kites, but within the past few years M. Richard of
Paris has made the simple and light recording
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg_126]</a></span>
instruments described in connection with balloons,
which can be attached to kites. In this way it is
possible to obtain simultaneous records at the kite
and at a station on the ground, and from them to
study the differences of temperature and humidity,
and this seems to have been done first at Blue Hill
Observatory. In August 1894 Mr. Eddy brought
his kites to Blue Hill and with them lifted a
Richard thermograph, which had been partly
reconstructed of aluminium by Mr. Fergusson so
that it weighed but 1&frac14; lbs., to the height of 1500
feet, and so the earliest automatic record of
temperature was obtained by a kite. During the
next summer, Mr. Eddy assisted again in the
experiments at Blue Hill, and secured photographs
of the Observatory and the hill by a camera
carried between his kites to the height of a hundred
feet or more.</p>

<p>Now that the possibility of lifting self-recording
meteorological instruments to considerable heights
had been demonstrated, an investigation of the
thermal and hygrometric conditions of the free air
was undertaken by the staff of the Blue Hill
Observatory, who had already made an investigation
of the movements of the clouds by the
methods described in the second chapter.</p>

<p>The development of the kite and its accessory
apparatus, and the acquisition of the knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg_127]</a></span>
how to use them, required much time, and resulted
in the damage or loss of many kites. Two
meteorographs, as the combination of two or more
self-recording instruments is called, were dropped
from a great height and no trace of them was
found. When, however, by the breaking of the
line both kites and instrument are carried away,
the kites act as a parachute and bear the instrument
gently to the ground, where both are usually
recovered uninjured; to facilitate their return
should they fall at a distance, the name and address
are marked on each. It would be tedious to relate
the ups and downs of scientific kite-flying at Blue
Hill before the wind was successfully harnessed to
the service of science, and the kites were prevented
from kicking over the traces, or from breaking
away, so only a brief account of the progress of
the work will be given, and then the methods at
present used will be described. At first the Eddy,
or Malay kites, as they are also called, covered
with paper or with varnished cloth, were coupled
tandem to secure greater safety and lifting power.
The principle of attaching kites at several points
on the line was early adopted at Blue Hill, for
although it can be demonstrated theoretically that
a greater height is possible by concentrating all
the pull at the end of the line, yet in the case
of a line which is not infinitely strong the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg_128]</a></span>
results are got by distributing the pull, and in
this way, too, kites can be added as the wind
conditions aloft warrant. To obviate the frequent
breaking of the bowed cross-piece, Mr. Fergusson
made it in two pieces, each being held in a metal
socket on the central stick, the two pieces forming
a dihedral angle towards the wind. It had the
advantage also of being readily taken apart for
transportation. This kite, shown in <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>, flew
at a high angle above the horizon and through a
considerable range of wind velocity, but it could
not be kept permanently in balance, or made to
adjust itself to great variations in wind velocity,
and therefore it was discarded.</p>

<p>The first meteorograph, a combined recording
thermometer and barometer (from which the
height can be calculated), was constructed by
Mr. Fergusson in August 1895, and three months
later he united a recording anemometer to the
thermometer, which was probably the first apparatus
of this kind to be attached to kites. A
meteorograph, recording the atmospheric pressure,
air temperature, and relative humidity, was ordered
from M. Richard of Paris in 1895, like one already
carried by French aeronauts, except that, since for
kites lightness is all-essential, M. Richard constructed
this triple-recorder for the first time of
aluminium, and hereby reduced its weight to 2<sup>4</sup>&#8260;<sub>5</sub> lbs.
One of these meteorographs was hung to a ring at
the point of attachment of the two kite-lines to the
main line, a method which was used until recently.
In August 1895, besides the Eddy kites, there was
first used the cellular or box kite, invented by
Lawrence Hargrave of Sydney, Australia, which
bears no resemblance to the conventional forms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg_130]</a></span>
kites and which it would not be supposed could
fly. As seen from <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a> its appearance is
that of two light boxes without tops or bottoms,
fastened some distance above each other. The
wind exerts its lifting force chiefly upon the front
and rear sides of the top box, the lower box, which
inclines to the rear, and so receives less pressure,
preserving the balance. The ends of the boxes,
being in line with the wind, keep the kite steady
and serve the purpose of the dihedral angle in the
Malay kite. The Japanese are said to fly a single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg_131]</a></span>
box, which is the prototype of the Hargrave double
cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="Fig_9"></a>
<div class="figcenter">

<span class="figcaption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>&mdash;Hargrave Kite.</span>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the present time some form of the Hargrave
kite is generally employed for scientific purposes.
On account of the weight of the large cord necessary
to control these kites, and the surface which it
presented to the wind, a height of 2000 feet could
not be reached, so, during the winter of 1895-6,
following Archibald's example and the methods of
deep-sea sounding employed by Captain Sigsbee,
U. S. N., steel pianoforte wire was substituted for
the cord. This wire is less than half as heavy,
and less than one-fourth the size of cord having
the same strength, and, moreover, its surface is
polished, which reduces the friction of the wind
blowing past it. With the wire the height of a
mile was reached in July, and a mile and two-thirds
above Blue Hill in October 1896.</p>

<p>Up to this time a reel turned by two men sufficed
to draw down the kites, but the increasing pull
and length of wire made recourse to steam-power
necessary. In January 1897 a grant of money
was allotted from the Hodgkins Fund of the Smithsonian
Institution for the purpose of obtaining
meteorological records at heights exceeding ten
thousand feet, and no doubt the first application
of steam to kite-flying was the winch built by
Mr. Fergusson with ingenious devices for distributing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg_132]</a></span>
oiling, and measuring the length of wire.
The cumulative pressure of the successive coils
of wire finally crushed the drum, and the next
apparatus applied the principle of Sir William
Thomson's deep-sea sounding apparatus, in which
there is no accumulation of pressure. In October
1897 records were brought down from eleven
thousand feet, or a thousand feet above the prescribed
height.</p>

<p>The kites and apparatus at present employed at
Blue Hill will now be described.</p>

<p>The kites are all of the multiplane type, and
mostly of Hargrave's construction with two rectangular
cells. These cells are covered with cloth
or silk, except at their tops and bottoms, and one
is secured above the other by four or more sticks.
The wooden frames are as light as possible, but
are made rigid by guys of steel wire that bind
them in all directions. The average weight is
about two ounces a square foot of lifting surface,
which is about the same weight a square foot as
the Eddy kites when all the surface is included in
the estimate. The largest of the Hargrave kites
stands nine feet high, weighs eleven pounds, and
contains ninety square feet of lifting surface, which
in the recent kites is arched, resembling the curvature
of a bird's wings, a construction that was
proposed many years ago by Phillips (<a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a>).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg_133]</a></span>
These curved surfaces increase the lift, or upward
pull, more than the drift, or motion to leeward,
and so the angular elevation is augmented without
materially adding to the total pull on the wire,
which should not exceed one-half its breaking
strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Modified Hargrave Kite at Blue Hill.
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important factor in the success
of the Blue Hill work was the invention by Mr.
Clayton of the regulating bridle which is applied
to every kite. An elastic cord is inserted in the
lower part of the bridle, to which the flying-line
is attached, and when the wind-pressure increases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg_134]</a></span>
this cord stretches, and causes the kite to diminish
its angle of incidence to the wind until the gust
subsides. A kite can be set to pull only a fixed
amount in the strongest wind, when the kite will
fly nearly horizontal. We are therefore able to
calculate the greatest pull which can be exerted
on the wire by all the kites. With this device the
kites have flown through gales of fifty or sixty
miles an hour without breaking loose or injuring
themselves. Another efficient kite which has been
used at Blue Hill is the so-called "aero-curve kite"
made by Mr. C. H. Lamson of Portland, Maine.
As is seen from <a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>, this kite resembles a
soaring bird, and it can be taken apart and folded
up for storage or transportation.</p>

<p>In general, the angle of the flying lines of the
Blue Hill kites is 50&deg; or 60&deg; above the horizon, and
in winds of twenty miles an hour the pull on the
line is about one pound for each square foot of
lifting surface in the kite. Kites can be raised in
a wind that blows more than twelve miles an hour
at the ground, and as the average velocity of the
wind for the year on Blue Hill is eighteen miles
an hour, the days are few when kites will not fly there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Lamson's Aero-curve Kite.
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wire to which the kites are attached is steel
music-wire, <sup>32</sup>&#8260;<sub>1000</sub> of an inch in diameter, weighing
fifteen pounds a mile, and capable of withstanding
a pull of three hundred pounds. The wire is spliced
in lengths of more than a mile with the greatest
care, special pains being taken that no sharp bends
or rust-spots occur which would cause it to break.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg_136]</a></span>
To lift the increasing weight of wire, kites are
attached at intervals of a few thousand feet, so
that the angle may be maintained as high as is
consistent with a safe pull, and this is done by
screwing on the wire aluminium clamps, to which
the kite-lines are fastened.  On account of the
greater stability and strength of the new kites, the
meteorograph is suspended directly from the top
kite. The Richard meteorograph, contained in
an aluminium cage of about a foot cube, weighs
less than three pounds, and it is only necessary
to screen the thermometer from the sun's rays to
obtain the true temperature of the air, since the
wind insures a circulation of air around the thermometer.
Another meteorograph, constructed by Mr.
Fergusson, records the velocity of the wind in
addition to the three other elements, and it weighs
no more than the French instrument.</p>

<p>The reeling apparatus is an example of how
the same apparatus may serve diametrically opposite
purposes. In sounding the deep sea the wire
must be pulled upwards, whereas in sounding the
heights of the atmosphere the wire must be pulled
in the reverse direction. Therefore the deep-sea
sounding apparatus has been altered by Mr.
Fergusson to pull obliquely downwards, the wire
passing over a swivelling pulley which follows
its direction and registers on a dial the exact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg_137]</a></span>
length unreeled. Next the wire bears against a
pulley carried by a strong spiral spring, by which
the pull upon it at all times is recorded on a paper-covered
drum turned by clockwork.  The wire
passes now several times around a strain-pulley,
and finally is coiled under slight tension upon a
large storage-drum. When the kites are to be
pulled down, the strain-pulley is connected with
a two-horse-power steam-engine, and the wire is
drawn in at a speed of from three to six miles an
hour; but when the kites are rising the belt is
removed, and the pull of the kites unreels the wire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="Fig_12"></a>

<span class="figcaption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span>&mdash;Meteorograph lifted by Kites at Blue Hill.</span>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The method of making a kite-flight for meteorological
purposes at Blue Hill is as follows: a
kite, fastened by a long wire to the ring in the main
wire, being in the air, and the meteorograph suspended,
another kite is attached to the ring by a
shorter cord (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>). They are then allowed to
rise, and to unreel the wire, until its angle with the
horizon becomes low, when, by means of the clamps
described, other kites are added, the number depending
on the size of the kites and the strength of the
wind. After a pause at the highest attainable
altitude, the winch is connected with the steam-engine
and the kites are drawn down. The pauses at the
highest point, and when kites are attached or detached,
are necessary to allow the recording instruments
to acquire the conditions of the surrounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg_139]</a></span>
air; and because at these times the meteorograph
is nearly stationary, measurements of its angular
elevation are made with a surveyor's transit, while
observations of azimuth give the direction of the
wind at the different heights. The time of making
each angular measurement is noted, so that the
corresponding point on the trace of the meteorograph
may be found. From the length of
the wire and its vertical angle, the height of the
meteorograph can be calculated, it having been
found that the sag of the wire, or its deviation
either in a vertical or a horizontal plane from
the straight line joining the kite and the reel,
does not cause an error exceeding three per cent.
in the height so computed. When the meteorograph
is hidden by clouds, the height above the
last point trigonometrically determined is computed
from the barometer record by Laplace's
formula. At night there is only the barometer
from which to determine the height; for although
an attempt was made to use a lantern to sight
upon, yet it soon became invisible, or, when seen,
was confounded with the stars. Before and after
the flight the meteorograph is hung upon a tripod
in the free air, in order that its thermometer and
hygrometer may be compared with the standards.</p>

<p>Since the use of wire and more efficient kites,
the heights have been greatly increased. Thus
the average height above the hill attained by the
meteorograph in thirty-five flights made during
1898 was more than a mile and a quarter, whereas
the average height of all the ascents prior to 1897
was about a quarter of a mile (see <a href="#Table_1">Table</a>). The
average height of the meteorograph above the hill,
in all the flights during August 1898, was nearly
a mile and a half, and on August 26 the meteorograph
was raised 360 feet higher than ever before,
its altitude, determined trigonometrically, being
11,440 feet above Blue Hill, or 12,070 feet above
the neighbouring ocean. The meteorograph was
suspended from the topmost kite, one of the
Lamson pattern, having 71 square feet of lifting
surface, and this was increased to a total of 149
square feet by four kites of the modified Hargrave
type, that were attached at intervals to the wire.
The five miles of wire in the air weighed 75 lbs.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg_141]</a></span>
and the total weight including kites and apparatus
was 112 lbs. The meteorograph left the ground
at 10:40 <span class="wsnb">a.m.</span>, attained its greatest height at 4:15
<span class="wsnb">p.m.</span>, and returned to the ground at 8:40 <span class="wsnb">p.m.</span>, a
feat which it would be difficult for a man to
equal on a mountain. The cumulus clouds were
traversed three-quarters of a mile from the earth,
and above them the air was found to be very dry.
On the hill the air temperature was 72&deg;, when it
was 38&deg; in the free air 11,440 feet above, and the
wind velocity increased from twenty-two to forty
miles an hour. These figures give an idea of the
change of atmospheric conditions which occurs, but
the conclusions deduced from the Blue Hill kite-flights
will be discussed in the next chapter. However,
the phenomena of atmospheric electricity,
which have become noticeable since the use of wire,
may be described here. Generally, whenever the
kites rise above seventeen hundred feet, the wire
becomes strongly charged with electricity, and
when the great heights are reached the electricity
is discharged in long and brilliant sparks at the
reel, often to the inconvenience of the attendants.
Usually, the electrical potential increases with
altitude, and it is greatest during snow-storms or
when the conditions favour thunder-storms. Notwithstanding
its intensity, the quantity of electricity
in the atmosphere is probably insufficient to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg_142]</a></span>
its collection and storage for practical purposes
worth while.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that kite-flying for
meteorological purposes is a sinecure. At Blue
Hill about two hundred flights have been made
in all seasons and in all weathers, with temperatures
varying from -&shy;5&deg; to +90&deg;, in gales, in rain,
and in snow-storms, though not in thunder-storms.
Sometimes the kites are invisible from almost the
time they leave the earth until their return, but when
the upper kites are visible it is necessary to observe
them with theodolites every few minutes. Remembering
that a high flight occupies ten or twelve
hours, and frequently terminates late at night, or
even continues until morning, it will be obvious
that the work requires skill, energy, and perseverance,
which have been shown by my assistants at
the Blue Hill Observatory who have conducted
the flights.</p>

<p>Occasionally, for lack of wind or from breakage
of the line, the kites fall to the ground, usually
intact. If they were visible, trigonometrical measurements
on the hill enable the place of descent to
be located, and then the kites and meteorograph
are sent for and the wire is reeled up. But at
night, or when clouds hide the kites, the direction
in which they fall is not known, because the
azimuth of the wire at the reel often differs from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg_143]</a></span>
that of the kites; so last autumn several hundred
miles of road, path, wood, and swamp were traversed
before the a&euml;rial apparatus, which had been
lost during a flight at night, was found comparatively
close at hand.</p>

<p>From what has been said it will be evident that
a former toy has been proved to be of the greatest
importance for meteorological investigation at the
Blue Hill Observatory. On account of the success
there attained it is coming into use elsewhere for
meteorological observations. In 1898 the United
States Weather Bureau created seventeen kite
stations, chiefly in the Mississippi Valley, with the
intention of obtaining data every day, at the height
of a mile or more, with which to plot a synoptic
weather map similar to the map that is now drawn
from the data at the ground. From a knowledge
of the weather conditions prevailing simultaneously
in the upper and lower air, it was expected that
the weather forecasts could be improved, but unfortunately,
on account of the light winds during
the summer, it was impossible to make enough
simultaneous kite-flights to construct the upper-air
map, and therefore the scheme was abandoned.
However, the data obtained will no doubt furnish
valuable information about the vertical temperature
gradient, etc., in various conditions of weather.
The chief meteorological bureaus of Germany and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg_144]</a></span>
Russia are equipping stations with kites and balloons,
and M. Teisserenc de Bort, who has provided
his private observatory near Paris with kite apparatus
of the Blue Hill type, has already reached
high altitudes. In Scotland too, which was the
birthplace of scientific kite-flying, experiments
have been resumed by a Scotchman and an
American&mdash;a happy union of forces.</p>

<p>From these preparations it appears that the
resolution of the International Aeronautical Conference,
recommending that all central observatories
should employ this method of investigation
as being of prime importance for the advancement

<div class="blockquot">RESULTS OF THE KITE-FLIGHTS AT BLUE HILL&mdash;FUTURE WORK</div>


<p>Kites possess several advantages over other
methods of exploring the air up to heights of at
least 12,000 feet whenever there is wind, but their
chief merit is, that with them the true conditions
of the air may be ascertained. The disadvantages
of other methods of exploring the air, as compared
with kites, are these:</p>

<p>1. <b>Mountains</b> not only affect by contact the
adjacent air, but by deflecting the air-currents
cause mixture and ascent, which give conditions
differing widely from those of the free air.</p>

<p>2. <b>Free Balloons</b> are more or less surrounded by
heated or stagnant air, because they drift with the
wind, and on account of the sluggishness of the
thermometers, the temperatures observed at a given
height in a balloon are generally higher during the
ascent, <i>i.e.</i> when passing from warm to cold air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg_146]</a></span>
than during the descent, when the conditions are
reversed. Again, it is not possible to study the
progressive changes in the atmospheric conditions
at one place, because observations in a drifting
balloon are not comparable with simultaneous ones
made at a station on the ground below. With
kites, however, the possibility of making frequent
and nearly vertical ascents and descents permits
observations to be obtained almost simultaneously
in superincumbent strata of air. The height of
the kite can usually be determined with an accuracy
not attainable by the barometer in a balloon.</p>

<p>3. <b>Captive Balloons</b>, although constructed so as
not to be driven down by wind, cannot rise nearly
so high as kites on account of the weight and
resistance of the cable necessary to control them,
and even the German kite-balloon, on account of
its large surface, would hardly withstand the strong
winds in which kites can fly.</p>

<p>4. <b>The Cost</b> of installing and operating either
mountain stations or balloons is much greater
than for kites.</p>

<p>The exploration of the lower two miles of air
with kites flown from Blue Hill is no doubt the
most complete ever made at one place. Nearly
two hundred records have been obtained in all kinds
of weather conditions, and the progressive attainment
of greater and greater heights is shown in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg_147]</a></span>
table in the preceding chapter. The records from
the flights have been discussed by Mr. Clayton;
those until February 1897, with the Blue Hill
Observations, in Vol. xlii., Part I., of the <i>Annals
of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College</i>,
and later records in two <i>Bulletins</i> of the Blue Hill
Observatory, in which the changes of temperature
and humidity with height, and their relation to the
positions of cyclones and anti-cyclones, are investigated.
The use of kites for weather predicting,
as was said, has been tried by the United States
Weather Bureau, but it is certain that further
studies, such as have been made on Blue Hill, are
necessary before the sequence of the conditions at
the earth's surface to the phenomena observed in
the upper air is definitely known, so that the latter
can be utilized in forecasting.</p>

<p>Some of the deductions from the observations
with kites at Blue Hill follow. <a href="#Plate_VIII">Plate VIII</a>. is a
facsimile of the record of the baro-thermo-hygrograph
during two flights on October 8, 1896, when
for the first time the height of a mile and a half
was attained. The record-sheet, it may be said,
is wrapped around a cylinder that turns on its axis
in twelve hours, and the curved lines in each of the
three horizontal sections divide them into quarter
hours. The lower section contains the trace of the
barometer, the horizontal lines being the heights in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg_148]</a></span>
metres and feet that correspond to the barometric
pressure with a temperature of 32&deg; Fahrenheit; in
the middle section is the trace of the hygrometer
on a scale of relative humidity in percentages, and
in the upper section is the trace of the thermometer
on a scale of temperatures in Fahrenheit and Centigrade
degrees. It will be observed that the record
of the barometer is reversed, <i>i.e.</i> the trace rises for
falling pressure, and in the second flight when the
unexpected height of 8697 feet above Blue Hill
was reached, the limit of the altitude scale was exceeded.</p>

<p>In order to study the changes of these elements
with height during the higher flight, in <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX</a>.,
Figs. <a href="#Fig_4">4</a> and <a href="#Fig_5">5</a>, the temperature and humidity of the
automatic record are plotted as absciss&aelig;, with the
heights above sea-level in metres as ordinates. For
those not familiar with this unit of length, it may be
said that 100 metres are about 330 feet, and that
1600 metres equal one mile approximately. When
the meteorograph was ascending, dots indicate the
recorded temperatures and humidities, which are
each connected respectively by continuous lines;
when the meteorograph was descending, crosses
indicate the observations, which are connected by
broken lines. Lines inclining upwards to the left
indicate decreasing temperature and humidity with
increase of height, and lines inclining to the right
increasing temperature and humidity with height.
The straight dotted lines show the adiabatic decrease
of temperature for ascending dry air. The
ascent was made during the warmest part of the
day, and the descent for the most part after sunset.
The two branches of the temperature-lines typify
the temperature change with height which usually
occurs in fair weather during the day and the night
respectively. The continuous line, representing the
day observations, shows a uniform fall of temperature
at the adiabatic rate to the cloud level. During
the night, the lower part of the broken line bends
decidedly to the left, showing a body of relatively
cold air near the ground, caused by radiation.
There is a rise of temperature with increasing
altitude above the ground up to a certain height,
and afterwards a comparatively uniform fall as
high as the clouds, if they exist; but the rate of
fall with increasing altitude, shown by the upper
part of the diagram, is slower at night than during
the day. It appears that the diurnal change of
temperature is very small at great altitudes, compared
with the change near the earth's surface.
The relative humidity (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>) up to 2000 metres
varies inversely with the temperature, and in the
present case there was only a slight change in the
direction of the wind (<a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<p><b>Diurnal Changes of Temperature at Different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg_152]</a></span>
Altitudes.</b>&mdash;The curve representing the diurnal
change in the air at some distance above the
ground is probably similar to one representing the
change near the ground, except that its amplitude
is less. If this be true, then the diurnal rate of fall
for a given time at any two levels will be proportional
to the daily ranges of temperature at the
two levels. It is impossible in practice to keep a
kite at exactly the same level for twenty-four hours;
hence the daily ranges for the different levels must
be found by comparing the rates of rise or fall of
temperature for given times with the rates found
from records near the ground, made simultaneously
with those above. In <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX</a>., <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>, the results
for six stations, <i>i.e.</i> the kite at 1000 and 500 metres,
the Eiffel Tower in Paris (300 metres), the summit
of Blue Hill, its base, and the valley (200, 50, and
15 metres respectively), are connected, and a
smooth curve is drawn through them. The curve
passes approximately through every one of the
observed and the computed ranges, except the one at
the summit of Blue Hill, which is too great. This
evidently is because insolation and radiation, acting
through the soil of the hill, heat and cool the air to
a greater extent than the free air is heated and
cooled at the same altitude, and this must be true
at every mountain station. The smoothed curve
passes also very slightly to the left of the data for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg_153]</a></span>
the Eiffel Tower, indicating that the range there is
about 1&deg; greater than the true range on account of
the heating and cooling of the Tower. From this
it appears that the diurnal range of temperature
diminishes rapidly with increasing altitude in the
free air, and almost disappears in the average at a
height of 1000 metres.</p>

<p>The records of the anemometer show that, as a
rule, the wind increases steadily as the kites rise,
but the increase is greatest between Boston and the
top of Blue Hill, due probably to the retarding of
the lower winds by contact with the ground. The
results are plotted in <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX</a>., <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>, together with
the mean wind velocity on Blue Hill (209 metres),
and the velocity on a tower in Boston (60 metres).
Single records of the kite-anemometer differ much,
for sometimes the wind velocity diminished with
altitude, and at other times it increased so rapidly
that the kites were unable to rise higher. On
several occasions when the kites passed from one
current into another, having a different direction
and a different temperature, the wind suddenly
increased, and was stronger between the two
currents than above or below that plane.</p>

<p><b>Diurnal Changes of Humidity at Different Altitudes.</b>&mdash;It
is found that as night approaches the
humidity at the altitude of 1000 metres diminishes,
while at the earth it increases. This agrees with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg_154]</a></span>
the evidence furnished by the cumulus clouds that
form during the day between 1000 and 2000
metres, and disappear at night, thus visibly indicating
an increase of humidity by day and a
decrease by night. If the trend of the humidity-curve
at a height of 1000 metres is assumed to be
the reverse of its trend at the ground, then the
results from the kite-meteorograph show the
minimum humidity to be at the coldest and the
maximum humidity at the warmest part of the
day. The mean daily ranges for different altitudes
are plotted in <a href="#Plate_IX">Plate IX</a>., <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>. The part of the
curve at the left of the zero line shows the range at
different altitudes, with the minimum humidity
near the warmest time of day, while the part at the
right of the zero shows the ranges at different
altitudes, with the minimum humidity at the coldest
time of day.</p>

<span class="smcap">Plate X.&mdash;Changes with Height recorded by Kites at Blue Hill.</span>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Types of Change of Temperature with Altitude.</b>&mdash;When
the records of temperature and humidity
made aloft by the kite-meteorograph and at the
stations near the ground are plotted in relation to
altitude, they are found to be easily divisible into
a few types. In <a href="#Plate_X">Plate X</a>., Type 1 represents the
decrease of temperature on most fair days from
the ground to altitudes of a mile or more, when
no clouds are met. The continuous line, plotted
from the records of the ascent, represents the day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg_156]</a></span>
conditions, and the broken line, plotted from the
records of the descent, represents the night conditions.
This curve shows that with increasing
altitude the temperature falls uniformly during
the day and approximately at the adiabatic rate
represented by the dotted lines. The fall of
temperature with increasing altitude during the
night is slower than during the day, and in fact,
from the earth's surface to an altitude of a few
hundred metres, there is often a rise of temperature
with height, so that the air at altitudes of from
300 to 500 metres may be considerably warmer
than it is at the ground. This was shown in the
descent on October 8, 1896, and is found in Type 3.</p>

<p>When clouds are traversed during the flight, the
temperature curve assumes the form of Type 2.
The continuous curve is plotted from the records
of an ascent; the broken curve from the records of
the descent, both occurring in the day-time. The
temperature falls at the adiabatic rate in unsaturated
air till the base of the cumulus cloud is
reached. It falls at a slower rate in the cloud, the
rate probably being that computed by physicists
as the adiabatic rate for air in which condensation
is taking place. Above the clouds, the fall of
temperature appears to be very slow.</p>

<p>Type 3 is a condition which persists throughout
the day and night, and it resembles the night form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg_157]</a></span>
of Type 1. The temperature rises very rapidly for
a short distance above the ground and then falls,
with increase of height, somewhat slower than the
adiabatic rate. The rise of temperature near the
ground with increasing height is more marked after
sunset than during the day-time.</p>

<p>Type 4 was illustrated by the ascent of October
8. This distribution of temperature is caused by
a warmer current overflowing colder air, which
is very commonly found at low altitudes in the
atmosphere and probably exists usually at some
altitude, great or small. Recent observations indicate
that this type represents the normal condition
of the atmosphere in all sorts of weather. Frequently
there are two or more sudden rises of
temperature at different heights, so that the plotted
data resemble inverted stair-steps. During the day
there is a decrease of temperature at the adiabatic
rate (1&deg;&middot;8 in 100 metres) from the ground to the
height of several hundred metres, then a sudden
rise of temperature in the next one or two hundred
metres, and above this a slow fall of temperature
with increasing altitude, usually much less than the
adiabatic rate. Generally, clouds are found near
the plane of meeting of the warm and cold current.</p>

<p>The reverse of Type 4, that is, a sudden fall of
temperature, due to a colder current overlying a
warmer one, is probably impossible, because the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg_158]</a></span>
colder air, on account of its greater weight, would
immediately begin to sink and the warmer air
would rise. This should cause a fall of temperature
at the adiabatic rate from the ground to the
top of the colder current, and is probably the origin
of the "cold wave" shown in Type 5. Both the
continuous and broken curves (representing an
ascent and a descent) show a fall of temperature at
the adiabatic rate of unsaturated air, from about
500 metres to the highest point reached. Up to
500 metres the decrease of temperature is more
rapid than the adiabatic rate, due to the rapid
moving in of colder air above, whereby air rising
from the ground is cooled by contact as well as by
its expansion, and also because the air is heated
more than usual by contact with the ground, which
under these conditions is abnormally warmer.
This is the special characteristic of the "cold
wave" type of curve during the day hours. The
night form of Type 5, notwithstanding the excessive
radiation from the ground through the dry air,
shows a rapid decrease of temperature with increase
of altitude from the ground upward.</p>

<p>Type 6 shows a less common, but an interesting
form, of vertical distribution of temperature, in
which the temperature is about the same from 400
metres to 1400 metres or more. Up to 400 metres
there is a fall of temperature with increasing altitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg_159]</a></span>
during the day, and a rise with increasing
altitude at night. These last conditions can be
readily traced to the effects of insolation and radiation
near the ground. In the morning, if the
temperature of the air be the same from the ground
up to 1000 metres or more, the heating of the
ground by the sun will cause ascending currents,
until the warmest part of the day. This air, cooling
by expansion at the adiabatic rate, will rise
to about 440 metres before it assumes the mean
temperature of the upper air column. At night
cooling takes place next the ground by radiation
and is gradually transferred upward a few hundred
metres by conduction, thus producing an increasing
temperature with increasing altitude, until sunrise.
As a result of the conditions described, it is evident
that on certain days the diurnal range of
temperature is but little felt above 500 metres.</p>

<p><b>Types of Change of Relative Humidity with Altitude.</b>&mdash;As
in the temperature types, the continuous
lines represent the records of the ascent, and the
broken lines the records of the descent, generally
under changing conditions. Lines inclining upward
to the left show a decreasing humidity, and
to the right an increasing humidity.</p>

<p>Type 1 may be called a normal type of curve
when there are clouds. A variation of this type
was met with in the ascent on October 8, 1896,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg_160]</a></span>
and it differed from that now illustrated in indicating
in its upper part a fall of humidity rather than
a rise. These two types can be taken as the
normal change of humidity with change of altitude
in cloudy or partly cloudy weather. The humidity
increases steadily to the base of the cloud, then
there is complete saturation in the cloud, and above
it is a sudden fall of humidity, on entering the dry
air above the cloud, into which the ascending
currents from the ground have not penetrated.</p>

<p>Type 3 is a clear-weather form of curve in which
the humidity increases until a certain altitude is
reached, probably at the upper limits of the
currents rising from the ground. Above this
altitude the humidity decreases rapidly.</p>

<p>Type 5 is also a clear-weather form and accompanies
the "cold wave" type of temperature, also
numbered 5. The very dry descending air mingles
with air rendered damp by ascent, and the result
is a nearly uniform relative humidity at different
altitudes, although the absolute humidity diminishes
on account of decreasing pressure and temperature.
In Type 6 both the relative and the absolute
humidity decrease rapidly, this type coinciding
with the temperature, Type 6.</p>

<p>During the week of September 5 to 11, 1897,
kite-flights were made daily on Blue Hill. Twice
the kites were maintained in the air, and continuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg_161]</a></span>
records were obtained during most of twenty-four
hours. These records furnish an example of the
small diurnal changes of temperature in the free air
at short distances above the ground, which were
deduced from the average changes at different
hours and at different heights. From 2 <span class="wsnb">p.m.</span> of the
fifth to 2 <span class="wsnb">p.m.</span> of the sixth, the altitude of the self-recording
instruments varied between 500 and 1000
metres above sea-level, averaging about 700 metres
and varying little from this height during much of
the night. The times when the kite-meteorograph
crossed the 700-metre level in ascending and
descending were determined from its barograph
trace, and the synchronous temperatures and humidities
were read from the records of its thermograph
and hygrograph. The results have been plotted
in <a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI</a>., Figs. <a href="#Fig_1">1</a> and <a href="#Fig_2">2</a>, together with the
temperatures recorded simultaneously at the summit
and valley stations of the Observatory and the
humidities at the summit. <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a> shows that the
diurnal variation of temperature, well marked at
the lower levels, is very slight or has entirely disappeared
at 700 metres. <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a> shows that the
course of the relative humidity at 700 metres is
exactly opposite in phase to that recorded at lower
levels, for at 700 metres the minimum humidity
was recorded at night and the maximum during
the day, while the opposite conditions prevailed on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg_162]</a></span>
the hill. Repeated kite-flights indicate that these
are the normal conditions at the two levels.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI</a>., <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>, is plotted a curve from the
hourly readings of the thermograph at the Blue
Hill valley station (fifteen metres) during the week,
and also a curve connecting temperatures recorded
by the kite-meteorograph once or twice each day
during the same week at a level of 500 metres,
obtained in the way described or computed from
the adiabatic change. All the night records show
that it was decidedly warmer at the height of 500
metres during the night than it was at the ground,
except during the cool wave on the seventh and
eighth. Furthermore, the curves in <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a> indicate
a control of the surface temperatures during the
day by those above. For instance, on the seventh
there was a distinct flattening of the day curve,
evidently because, as the temperature on the ground
rose 10&deg; above that at 500 metres, the air was in
unstable equilibrium, and colder air descended
to take the place of the surface air so that its
temperature could rise no higher. On the tenth,
the temperature at 500 metres was considerably
greater than the mean of the day at the ground,
and the air at the ground did not acquire the
unstable condition in any volume until the warmest
part of the day, so that the diurnal curve at the
lower station forms a sharp peak.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg_164]</a></span></p>
<p>Since there appears to be no appreciable diurnal
period in the temperature at and above 500 metres,
a better comparison of the relative changes aloft
and below during the passage of warm and cold
waves is obtained by smoothing out the diurnal
period below. This has been done in <a href="#Plate_XI">Plate XI</a>.,
<a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a>, with the data given by the kites at 500
and 1000 metres plotted in curves, which it was
necessary to complete by extrapolation. It is seen
that there is a much greater range in the temperature
from the crest of a warm to the crest of a cold
wave at a height of 500 metres than at the ground.
At 1000 metres the range appears to be slightly
greater than at 500 metres, and the crests of the
warm and cold waves occur successively earlier
than they do at the ground. On the approach,
and until the passage of the crest of the cold wave
the air is colder aloft than at the ground, the
difference being apparently that of the adiabatic
cooling of ascending air. After the passage of the
crest of the cold wave, the temperature aloft rises
much more rapidly than at the ground, and at the
crest of the warm wave the air at 500 metres is
some 10&deg; warmer than the mean daily temperature
at the ground. In many kite-flights the difference
was found to be even greater than this. Taking
the mean temperature of twenty-four-hours, it is
seen that the average temperature at the ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg_165]</a></span>
during a week or more is about the same as it is at
500 metres. <a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a> shows the change in the vertical
distribution of temperature during the oncoming
of the warm wave on the eighth and early morning
of the ninth, as determined by four ascents, culminating
at 11 <span class="wsnb">a.m.</span>, 9 <span class="wsnb">p.m.</span>, 11 <span class="wsnb">p.m.</span>, and 4 <span class="wsnb">a.m.</span>
The lines of 59&deg;, 62&deg;, 65&deg;, and 68&deg; show that there
was a gradual rise of temperature aloft, which extended
downwards to 200 metres, or to the top of
Blue Hill. Clouds formed at the level of lowest
temperature, and these sank also until they covered
the top of the hill.</p>

<p><a href="#Plate_XII">Plate XII</a>. is a facsimile of the meteorogram
during the kite-flight of October 15, 1897, the
lower part showing the trace of the barometer on
a scale of heights in metres, the middle section
the trace of the hygrometer, and the upper one
the trace of the thermometer on a scale of Centigrade
degrees. The temperature followed the
normal change, which is as follows: during the
day, up to a certain height, which varies under
different conditions, there is a decrease nearly at
the adiabatic rate of 1&deg;&middot;8 F. per hundred metres.
Above that height the air suddenly becomes
warmer, and then cools with ascent at a rate somewhat
less than the adiabatic rate. During the
night there is a marked inversion of temperature
between the ground and 200 or 300 metres.</p>

<p>Higher than this, the temperature decreases at a
fairly uniform rate, but more slowly than the
adiabatic rate. Although no clouds were visible,
yet the relative humidity increased greatly, both
during the ascent and descent, near 1500 and 2700
metres, these being about the heights at which
cumulus and alto-cumulus clouds usually form.</p>

<p>During September 1898 four kite-flights were
made on four successive days when an anti-cyclone
and a cyclone passed nearly over Blue Hill. This
is a rare occurrence, and the mechanism of these
phenomena was accordingly studied by Mr.
Clayton, some of whose deductions will now be
given, illustrated by <a href="#Plate_XIII">Plate XIII</a>. Figs. <a href="#Fig_1">1</a> and <a href="#Fig_2">2</a>
give the temperature plotted according to height
on September 21 in the anti-cyclone, and on
September 22, when the barometric pressure was
falling, the full lines, as in previous diagrams,
indicating observations during the ascents, and the
broken lines observations during the descents. It
is seen that from the ground the lines all incline
upward to the left, indicating a fall of temperature,
to a certain height when the lines bend to the right
sharply, showing a sudden rise of temperature.
Above this, the temperature again falls, but more
slowly than at lower levels. The general prevalence
of this phenomenon was noted by Welsh in his
balloon ascents in England in 1854, and the high
kite-flights at Blue Hill show it to be very frequent
below 2000 metres. The plane of increased temperature
usually determines the height of the tops
of cumulus and strato-cumulus clouds. Above
2000 metres other sudden rises of temperature are
found during the highest kite-flights.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#Fig_3">3</a> to <a href="#Fig_6">6</a> show the changes in the various
elements during the four days at some of the
following levels, viz. near sea-level, 200, 1000,
2000, and 3000 metres. <a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a> shows the changes
in the barometer at the four levels, from which it
is evident that the fall of pressure was greatest
near sea-level.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a> shows temperature changes at the different
levels, and indicates that the changes were of
the same nature up to 3000 metres. The greatest
non-diurnal range of temperature is seen to be at
1000 metres, and it diminishes both at higher and
at lower levels.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a> shows changes in relative humidity at
200, 1000, and 2000 metres. The curves show that
the greatest range of humidity was at 2000 metres.
There the relative humidity rose from almost zero,
in the anti-cyclone on the twenty-first, to saturation
at the same level in the cyclone. At 200 metres
the change is similar to that at 2000, but is less
in amount. At 1000 metres the relative humidity
fell until the twenty-second, but then rose rapidly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg_170]</a></span>
showing the very dry air at 2000 metres on the
twenty-first had descended as low as 1000 metres
on the twenty-second.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a> gives the change in wind velocity at the
different levels. There was an increase of wind at
all the levels from the time of the passage of the
anti-cyclone to the passage of the cyclone. The
minimum of wind at 200 metres was in the anti-cyclone,
with a secondary minimum during the
passage of the centre of the cyclone.</p>

<p>Figs. <a href="#Fig_7">7</a> to <a href="#Fig_10">10</a> show the changes in height from
day to day of the equal conditions at the different
levels. <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a> shows the change in level of the
isobars, which, although very small, is largest at the
lower levels. The light broken lines in <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>
and subsequent figures indicate the axes of the
anti-cyclone and cyclone. That the axis of the
cyclone was inclined backward, and that the high
pressure occurred later at high than at low levels,
was confirmed by the wind observations on the
twenty-first.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a> shows the heights at which the same
temperatures were found on successive days.
Since the isotherms rose until the twenty-third,
the temperature of the air up to 3000 metres was
higher on the day of the cyclone than on the day of
the anti-cyclone. Previous high flights indicate that
this is the normal condition in the moving cyclones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg_171]</a></span>
and anti-cyclones of the eastern United States.
As the light broken lines represent the axes of the
anti-cyclone and cyclone up to 3000 metres, it is seen
that at this level the temperature at the place of
maximum pressure is probably higher than at the
place of minimum pressure, although this is not
true for a vertical column of air above the earth.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a> gives the positions of equal humidities on
successive days, saturated and cloudy areas being
indicated by crossed shading, and less humidity by
single ruling. From the laws of thermo-dynamics
the unshaded curves should represent descending
currents, and the shaded portions ascending ones.
In the first case, increased warmth and a lower
relative humidity are produced in the descent to a
lower altitude; in the last case, cooling, increasing
relative humidity, and condensation are produced
by expansion in the ascent to a higher altitude.
Consequently, two regions of descending air are
indicated, one in the centre of the anti-cyclone, the
other in the centre of the cyclone.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a> shows the change in height of the lines
of equal wind velocity. With ascending currents
and precipitation, high wind velocities were found
at low levels, because of increased barometric
gradient, while with the descending currents in the
anti-cyclone and centre of the cyclone, the high
velocities were found only at great altitudes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg_172]</a></span>
The study of these data indicate that the
cyclonic and anti-cyclonic circulations observed in
this latitude do not embrace any air-movements at
greater altitudes than 2000 metres, except in front
of the cyclone, when the air appears to be carried
upward to a great height. Above 2000 metres
there are probably other weak cyclones and anti-cyclones,
or secondary ones, with their centres at
different places from those at the earth's surface
and producing a different circulation of wind. The
observations of the cirrus clouds at Blue Hill
indicate that at their level exists a cyclonic circulation
above the anti-cyclone apparent at the earth's
surface. The shallowness of our anti-cyclones
would be inferred from the great differences in
speed of the general atmospheric drift, for since
the velocity of the general drift from the west
is more than thirty times greater at 10,000 metres
than it is at 200 metres, a circulation of great
depth could not endure long. Cyclones and anti-cyclones
appear to be but secondary phenomena in
the great waves of warm and cold air which sweep
across the United States from periodic causes.</p>

<p>The origin of cyclones and anti-cyclones is
perhaps the most important problem remaining for
meteorological study. The theory that they are
produced by differences of temperature in adjacent
masses of air, or, as it is called, the convectional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg_173]</a></span>
theory of the American meteorologists, Espy and
Ferrel, is opposed by the observations on mountains
in Europe which were collected by Dr. Hann of
Vienna. If the question can be solved by the use
of kites, as seems to be foreshadowed by the
results just stated, another foundation-stone will
be laid in the science of meteorology and the
status of the kite established as an instrument of
research. The kite fails when there is little or no
wind at the ground, but it seems possible in such
cases to lift the kite into the upper air, where there
usually is wind, by attaching it to a small balloon
that, after the kite can support itself, shall be
detached automatically. While the height to
which kites can rise is limited, and the limit is
probably being approached, judging from the less
gain of altitude in recent flights, yet it seems
reasonable to expect that, with favourable conditions,
a height of at least three miles will be reached.</p>

<p>Besides lifting the meteorological instruments
described, kites can carry apparatus for other
investigations in the free air, such as the measurement
of atmospheric electricity, and the collection
of samples of air, to be examined for cosmic
dust and bacteria. Cameras have been lifted
by kites, as already said, and for the purpose
of photographing the upper surfaces of clouds
there is being constructed for the Blue Hill Observatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg_174]</a></span>
a very light automatic camera, similar in
principle to M. Cailletet's apparatus for photographing
the ground from a balloon.</p>

<p>The use of the kite as an aeroplane can only be
alluded to in this book, and it may be sufficient to
say that if a motor attached to a kite can, by wings
or screws, propel it against the wind, the sustaining
string is unnecessary, and we shall have the flying
machine which Professor Langley tells us will soon
be realized. The surface of our globe has been
tolerably well explored; the exploration of the
atmosphere by balloons and kites will continue to
make great progress during the last year of the
century, and at the end of the twentieth century
we may confidently expect that as the seas now
are a medium for transportation, so the ocean of
air will have been brought likewise into man's
domain.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
